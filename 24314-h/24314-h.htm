<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>It is a custom in some quarters to represent Mohammadan
mysticism as merely a late importation into
Islam, and an altogether alien element in it. But
however much later Islamic mysticism may have derived
from Christian, Neo-platonic, and Buddhist sources,
there is little doubt that the roots of mysticism are to
be found in the Koran itself. The following verse is
an instance: "God is the Light of the heavens and
the earth. His light is like a niche in which is a lamp,
the lamp encased in glass&mdash;the glass as it were a
glistening star. From a blessed tree is it lighted, the
olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil
would well nigh shine out even though fire touched
it not! It is light upon light!" (<i>Koran Sura</i> 24).</p>

<p>Indeed it seems strange to accord the title of "a
practical mystic" to Cromwell and to deny it to Mohammad,
whose proclivity for religious meditation was
so strong that the Arabs used to say "Muhammad is
in love with his Maker,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and whose sense of the "terror
of the Lord" was so intense that it turned his hair
prematurely white. Many of the reported sayings
of the Early Companions of Muhammad show that
they shared this terror. "Verily, you shall see hell,
you shall see it with the eye of certainty" says the
Koran, and they thought it very probable. Thus Ali
exclaimed "Alas for the shortness of the provision
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
and the terrors of the way!" Abu'l Darda said "If
ye knew what ye shall see after death, ye would not
eat nor drink, and I wish that I were a tree that is
lopped and then devoured."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>This "fear of the Lord" led naturally to an almost
fierce asceticism. Abu Bekr and Ali both founded
communities of ascetics,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and during the first and
second centuries of Islam there were many orthodox
mystics. Professor Nicholson in the work just quoted,
rightly says "I do not think that we need look beyond
Islam for the origin of the Sufi doctrines.... The
early Sufis are still on orthodox ground, their relation
to Islam is not unlike that of the medi&aelig;val Spanish
mystics to the Roman Catholic Church."</p>

of papers by continental scholars such as Alfred
Von Kremer, Pavet de Courteille, and A.F. Mehren.
The essays on Ghazzali and Jalaluddin Rumi are,
however, founded on original study of those writers.
The translator hopes a wholesome tonic may be found
in some of these Moslem mystics at a time when many
"Christian" pulpits and presses seem anxious to dilute
Christianity "into a presumptuous and effeminate love
which never knew fear."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>PANTHEISTIC SUFISM<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></h4>

<h5>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE IMPORT OF ISLAMIC MYSTICISM</span></h5>


<p>The moral law proclaimed by Moses three thousand
years ago agrees with that which governs men to-day,
irrespective of their various stages of culture; the
moral precepts of a Buddha and Confucius agree with
those of the Gospel, and the sins for which, according
to the Book of the Dead of the ancient Egyptians,
men will answer to the judges of the other world are sins
still after four thousand years. If the nature of the
unknown First Cause is ever to be grasped at all, it
can only be in the light of those unchanging moral
principles which every man carries in his own breast.
The idea of God is therefore not an affair of the understanding,
but of the feeling and conscience. Mysticism
has always so taken it, and has therefore always had
a strong attraction for the excitable and emotional
portion of mankind whom it has comforted in trial
and affliction. Every religion is accordingly rather
intended for the emotions than for the understanding,
and therefore they all contain mystical tendencies.
The mysticism of Islam and Christendom have many
points of contact, and by mysticism perhaps will be
first bridged the wide gulf which separates Islam from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>Christendom, and thereby from modern civilisation.
Just in proportion as the various religions express
the ideals of goodness and truth they approximate to
one another as manifestations of the unchanging moral
principle. Inasmuch as they surmised this, the
Motazilites (or free-thinkers in Islam), at a time when
Europe lay in the profoundest intellectual and moral
bewilderment, fought for one of those ideas which,
although they are quickly submerged again in the stormy
current of the times, continue to work in silence and
finally emerge victorious. On that day when the
Moslem no longer beholds in God simply omnipotence,
but also righteousness, he will simultaneously re-enter
the circle of the great civilised nations among whom
he once before, though only for a short time, had won
the first place.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps too fanciful to hail, as an omen of
the triumph of moral mysticism over the dogmatic
rigidity of Islam, the fact that the present Sultan
Muhammad V. was girded with the sword of Osman
by the head of the Mevlevi dervishes, a sect founded
by the great mystic teacher Jalaluddin Rumi of
Iconium. Forty-three years ago a Persian Orientalist
Mirza Kasim Beg wrote in the <i>Journal Asiatique:&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"<i>L'unique voie qui dans l'Islam puisse conduire à la reforme
c'est la doctrine du mysticisme.</i>"</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">EARLIER PHASES</span></h4>

<p>The period during which the asceticism practised
by the earlier Sufis passed into the dreamy pantheism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
which characterises the later Sufism is the end of the
third century after Muhammad. This introduced a
new element into Islam which for centuries exercised
a powerful influence on national culture, and is still
partially operative at present. The conception of God
and of the relation of the finite and human with the
infinite and divine from this time onward formed the
chief subject of inquiry and meditation.</p>

<p>The man who was destined to be the first to give
those ideas, which had hitherto been foreign to Arabian
Sufism, definite expression was a poor workman, a
cotton-carder, bearing the name of Hellaj. He was an
Arabised Persian, born in Persia, but educated in
Irak, where he enjoyed the privilege of being instructed
by Junaid. The story of his life as handed down by
Shiah or Sunni writers has been much exaggerated.
It is clear, however, that he had a great number of
disciples who revered him as their spiritual guide and
ascribed to him almost supernatural powers. His
ever-growing popularity much scandalised the orthodox
mullahs, who moved the authorities to proceed against
him, and were successful in procuring his execution
<span class="smcap">922 a.d.</span> Before his death he was subjected to terrible
tortures, which he bore with wonderful composure.</p>

<p>The reason of his condemnation was declared to be
that he regarded himself as an incarnation of the
Godhead. His disciples honoured him as a saint
after his death. They ascribed to him the famous
saying, "I am the Truth" (<i>i.e.</i> God), which they took
in a pantheistic sense. He is said to have taught the
doctrine of the incarnation of the Godhead in a man
and to have uttered the exclamation:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Praise to the Most High Who has revealed His humanity
and concealed the overpowering splendour of His Deity. Whoso
purifies himself by abstinence and purges himself from every
trace of fleshiness, unto him the Spirit of God enters, as it
entered into Jesus. When he has attained to this degree of
perfection, whatever he wills, happens, and whatever he does
is done by God.</p></div>

<p>His letters to his disciples are said to have commenced
with the formula, "From the Lord of Lords to His
slaves." His disciples wrote to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>O Spirit of the Spirit! O highest Aim of the holy: We bear
witness that Thou hast incarnated Thyself in the form of Hosain
the cotton-carder (Hellaj). We flee for protection to Thee
and hope in Thy mercy, O Knower of secrets.</p></div>

<p>The genuineness of these fragments has much to
support it, but is not entirely beyond doubt. This
much, however, is clear, that the disciples of Hellaj
after his death regarded him as a divine being. Ibn
Hazm, a trustworthy author who wrote only 150
years after the execution of Hellaj, says so expressly.
Ghazzali, who wrote about fifty years later still, does
not mention this, but shelters Hellaj from the charge
of blasphemy by construing his exclamation "I am
the Truth" in a pantheistic sense, and excuses it by
ascribing it to an excess of love to God and to mystic
ecstacy. In another place he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first veil between God and His servant is His servant's
soul. But the hidden depth of the human heart is divine and
illuminated by light from above; for in it is mirrored the
eternal Truth completely, so that it encloses the universe in
itself. Now when a man turns his gaze on his own divinely
illumined heart he is dazzled by the blaze of its beauty, and
the expression "I am God!" easily escapes him. If from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
falls into error and is ruined. It is as though he had allowed
himself to be misled by a little spark from the light-ocean of
Godhead instead of pressing forward to get more light. The
ground of this self-deception is that he in whom the Super-*natural
is mirrored confuses himself with it. So the colour of
a picture seen in a mirror is sometimes confounded with the
mirror itself.</p></div>

<p>Hellaj was no more than the representative of an
old idea, Indian in origin, which he combined with
Sufism, thereby giving an entirely new direction to
Islamic thought, which was important, as leading to
an entirely new development of the conception of God.
Even previous to Hellaj, the doctrine of incarnation
had emerged in Islam. The Caliph Ali was reported
to have been such, and was accordingly venerated by the
Shiahs. The sect of the Khattabiyah worshipped the
Imam Jafar Sadik as God. Another sect believed
that the Divine Spirit had descended upon Abdallah
Ibn Amr.</p>

<p>In Khorassan the opinion was widely spread that
Abu Muslim, the great general who overturned the
dynasty of the Ommeyads and set up that of the
Abbasides, was an incarnation of the spirit of God.
In the same province under Al Mansur, the second
Abbaside Caliph, a religious leader named Ostasys
professes to be an emanation of the Godhead. He
collected thousands of followers, and the movement
was not suppressed without much fighting. Under
the Caliph Mahdi a self-styled Avatar named Ata
arose, who on account of a golden mask which he
continually wore was called <i>Mokanna</i>, or "the veiled
prophet." He also had a numerous following, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>held the Caliph's armies in check for several years,
till in <span class="smcap">779 a.d</span>., being closely invested in his castle, he,
with his whole harem and servants, put an end to
themselves.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the second century after
Muhammad, Babek in Persia taught the transmigration
of souls and communism. His followers, named
Khoramiyyah, long successfully resisted the Caliph's
troops. He claimed that the soul of an ancient law-giver
named "Bod" had passed into him, which meant
perhaps that he wished to pass for a "Buddha."</p>

<p>It is well known that Shiite teachers were especially
active in Persia. In the apotheosis of Ali, as well as
in the cases of Abu Muslim, we find an assertion of the
ideas peculiar to the Persians in pre-Islamic times.
The infusion or indwelling of the Godhead in man
as with the Hindu Avatars was also popular, and widely
spread in Persia. In Bagdad, from the time of the
early Abbasides, the Persians had exercised great
influence. Shiahs were able to profess their views
freely under the tolerant or rather religiously indifferent
Caliph Mamoun. Bagdad early harboured within
its walls a number of communities imbued with Shiah
doctrine, and the Persian conception of God silently,
but widely prevailed.</p>

<p>Hellaj, educated in the orthodox Sunni school of
Junaid, which, through its laying stress on the idea
of love to God, possessed rather a mystic than dogmatic
character, allowed himself to be carried away by his
passionate temperament into not only preaching, but
practically applying to himself the above-mentioned
doctrines, which though known to many, had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>discreetly veiled in reserve. When once the populace
have been prepared for a new idea, the mere expression
of it is sufficient to act as a spark on tinder. The
fatal word was spoken by Hellaj; the authorities did
their duty, seized the daring innovator and put him to
death in the cruel fashion of the time. But the word
once spoken had been borne on the winds in all directions,
and the execution of Hellaj gave a powerful impulse
to the spread of his doctrine. There are periods in the
lives of some nations when the longing for a martyr's
crown becomes epidemic. A few years after the
execution of Hellaj, a man of the people, Ibn Aby Azkyr,
from the same village, Shalmaghan, where Hellaj
had spent his youth, gave himself out as an incarnation
of the Godhead. He was put to death with several
of his followers under the reign of the Caliph Radhi,
<span class="smcap">933 a.d.</span> A century after Hellaj an Egyptian, Ismail
Darazy, from whom the Druses derive their name,
proclaimed the Fatimite Caliph Hakim to be an incarnation.</p>

<p>How great was the influence exercised in general
by those ideas for which Hellaj died a martyr's death
we learn most clearly from the pages of Ghazzali, who
wrote not quite two hundred years later. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The speculations of the Sufis may be divided into two classes:
to the first category belong all the phrases about love to God
and union with Him, which according to them compensate for
all outward works. Many of them allege that they have attained
to complete oneness with God; that for them the veil has been
lifted; that they have not only seen the Most High with their
eyes, but have spoken with Him, and go so far as to say "The
Most High spoke thus and thus." They wish to imitate Hellaj,
who was crucified for using such expressions, and justify them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>selves
by quoting his saying, "I am the Truth." They also
refer to Abu Yazid Bistamy, who is reported to have exclaimed,
"Praise be to me!," instead of "Praise be to God!" This
kind of speculation is extremely dangerous for the common
people, and it is notorious that a number of craftsmen have
left their occupation to make similar assertions. Such speeches
are highly popular, as they hold out to men the prospect of
laying aside active work with the idea of purging the soul
through mystical ecstasies and transports. The common people
are not slow to claim similar rights for themselves and to catch
up wild and whirling expressions. As regards the second class
of Sufi speculation, it consists in the use of unintelligible phrases
which by their outward apparent meaning and boldness attract
attention, but which on closer inspection prove to be devoid
of any real sense.</p></div>

<p>These words of the greatest thinker among the
Muhammadans at that time afford us a deep insight
into the remarkable character of the period. From
them we gather with certainty that the division of
Sufism into two classes, one orthodox and outwardly
conforming to Islam, and the other free-thinking and
pantheistic, was already an accomplished fact before
Ghazzali's time. We recognise also that the latter
kind of Sufism was very popular among the lowest
classes of the people and even among the agricultural
population. The fundamental characteristic of
mysticism, the striving after the knowledge of God by
way of ecstatic intuition, had already come into open
conflict with the fundamental principles of Islam.
"Mystical love to God" was the catchword which
brought people to plunge into ecstatic reverie, and by
complete immersion in contemplation to lose their
personality, and by this self-annihilation to be absorbed
in God. The simple ascetic character of the ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>Arabian Sufism was continually counteracted by the
element of passive contemplation which was entirely
foreign to the Arab mind. The terms "ascetic" and
"Sufi," which were formerly almost synonymous,
henceforward cease to be so, and often conceal a fundamental
variance with each other. We shall not go
very far wrong if we connect the crisis of this intellectual
development with the appearance of Hellaj, so that
the close of the third and commencement of the fourth
century after Muhammad marks the point of time when
this philosophico-religious schism was completed. In
Persia the theosophy of Hellaj and his supporters
found a receptive soil and flourished vigorously; on
that soil were reared the finest flowers of Persian poetry.
From the Persians this tendency passed over to the
Turks, and the poetry of both nations contains strongly-marked
theosophical elements.</p>


<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE LOVE OF GOD AND ECSTASY</span></h4>

<p>Already in the second century of Islam great stress
was laid upon the cultivation of love to God, an outstanding
example of which is the female Sufi Rabia.
With it was connected a gradually elaborated doctrine
of ecstatic states and visions which were believed to
lead by the way of intuition and divine illumination to
the spiritual contemplation of God. We have already
endeavoured to describe the religious enthusiasm which
took possession of the Moslems in the first and second
century after Muhammad and have partly traced the
causes which led to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Ecstasy is an invariable concomitant of religious
enthusiasm. In the endeavour to break through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>narrow bounds which confine the human spirit pious
and credulous natures are only too easily led astray.
The instruments which man has at his command
when he wishes to investigate the supernatural do not
suffice to procure him an even approximately correct
image of the object which he would fain observe. While
the optician with the aid of mathematics can reduce
errors arising from the convexity of his magnifying
lens to an infinitesimally small amount, the theologian
has never found a device, and never will find one, to
obviate the errors which arise from the fact that his
intellectual insight has to be exercised through the
medium of material senses, which obscure the clearness
of his observation. And yet it is precisely this ceaseless
striving, this irresistible impulse after something higher,
this unquenchable thirst for the fountain-head of
knowledge, which constitutes the highest and noblest
side of humanity, and is the most indubitable pledge
of its spiritual future. The net result of these
strivings has been an endless series of self-delusions,
and yet humanity takes on a grander aspect in
them than in all its other manifold efforts and
successes. The history of this spiritual wrestling, this
hopeless and yet never relaxed struggle against the
impossible, forms the noblest aspect of the history of
mankind.</p>

<p>The phenomena produced by Islam in this respect
do not fundamentally differ from those produced by
Christianity and Buddhism. Sufism exhibits a more
remarkable development of these phenomena, simply
because it grew up in an environment which favoured
their more luxuriant growth.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>
<p>The Koran, which Muhammad came, as he said
to preach, was regarded as the very word of God, and
must therefore have produced an overpowering impression
on the minds of the faithful. Of this numerous
instances are reported. Abd al Wahid ibn Zaid heard
one day a Koran-reader recite the following verse
(Sura 45: 28):&mdash;"This is Our book, which announces
to you the truth; for We have caused to be recorded
all that ye have done. Those who believe and do good
works shall their Lord admit to His favour; verily
this is the most manifest recompense." On hearing
this Abd al Wahid broke into loud weeping and fainted.
Miswar ibn Machramah was not even able to hear any
verse of the Koran read, being so powerfully affected
thereby as to become senseless. Of Jobair ibn Motim
it is reported that he said: "I heard the Prophet recite
the following verses of the Koran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. I swear by Tur.</span>
<span class="i0">2. By a book which stands written on outspread parchment.</span>
<span class="i0">3. By the house to which pilgrimage is made.</span>
<span class="i0">4. By the lofty dome of heaven.</span>
<span class="i0">5. And by the swelling ocean.</span>
<span class="i0">6. That the judgment of thy Lord is at hand.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then it appeared to me," said Jobair, "as if my heart
would burst in twain." The pious Cadi Ijad adduces
as a special proof of the inspiration of the Koran the
deep impression of fear and terror which its recital
produced on the minds of the hearers.</p>

<p>Muhammad ibn Mansur relates that once passing a
house at midnight he heard the voice of a man praying
to God loudly and fervently, lamenting his sins with
deep contrition. Muhammad ibn Mansur could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>resist the temptation; he put his mouth to the keyhole
and uttered the verse which threatens the unbelievers
with hell-fire. He heard a heavy fall within the house,
and all was still. As he went down the same street the
next morning he saw a corpse being carried out of the
same house, followed by an old woman. He inquired
of her whose body it was, and she answered: "Last
night my son heard a verse of the Koran recited, and
it broke his heart." We are far from believing all these
stories, but they show what a view was held in the
earliest times regarding the effect produced by the
Koran on the minds of those who heard it.</p>

<p>The ecstatic bent of mind of the ascetics of Islam
and the later Sufis arose from these beginnings. Then,
as now, self-originated phases of feeling were attributed
to outer causes; from the remotest times men have sought
without them the Divinity which they carried within.</p>

<p>The wider spread and greater permanence of ecstatic
phenomena among the Moslems than elsewhere was
due to the concurrence of various conditions, chief
among which was the peculiar temperament of the
Arab. Capable of the fiercest momentary excitement,
he quickly subsided into a state of complete apathy
which is pain-proof. I<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> have a lively recollection of the
cases mentioned by my late friend Dr. Bilharz, who
spoke of the astonishing an&aelig;sthesia which the patients
in the medical school of Kasr al 'ain in Cairo, where he
was professor, exhibited under the most painful operations.
They uttered hardly a sound when operated
upon in the most sensitive nerve-centres. The negro,
notoriously excitable as he is, and therefore still more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>exposed to complete prostration of the organs of feeling,
exhibits this apathy in a yet more marked degree than
the Arab and Egyptian. Many examples of this are
found in old Arabic authors&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, in the narratives of the
martyrdoms of Hatyt, of Hellaj and of a young Mameluke
crucified in <span class="smcap">1247 a.d.</span> Of the last Suyuti has preserved
a psychologically detailed description.</p>

<p>Although Christian martyrology is rich in such
instances of unshakable fortitude under the most
painful tortures, yet in Islam the ecstatic temper has
attained a higher significance and been more constantly
exhibited. A chief reason of this was the religious
fanaticism, which was incomparably stronger and
more widely diffused in Islam than in medi&aelig;val Christendom.
The minds of the Moslems were kept in perpetual
tension by severe religious exercises, the effect
of which was intensified by fasts and pilgrimages.
The peculiar manner of life in the desert, the birthplace
of Islam, also contributed to this; the scanty
diet, the loneliness of the desert, and in the towns the
want of civic life, the poverty of ideas among the Arabs,
all helped to produce the same result. Finally,
deception, hypocrisy, and superstition, as, alas, so
often is the case in religious matters, played a great
part. Whoever did not feel ecstatically moved at
the recitation of the Koran pretended to be so, and
often thereby, perhaps unconsciously, exercised a
great effect on others. Men began by pretending to
feel religious enthusiasm and ended by believing that
they really felt it. Ghazzali mentions in the Ihya ul-ulum
that the prophet commanded that whoever did
not feel moved to tears at the recitation of the Koran
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>should pretend to weep and to be deeply moved; for,
adds Ghazzali sagely, in these matters one begins by
forcing oneself to do what afterwards comes spontaneously.
Moreover, the fact that religious excitement
was looked upon as the mark of a fervent mind and
devout intensity, vastly increased the number of
those who claimed mystic illumination.</p>

<p>When verses of the Koran through frequent repetition
lost their power to awaken ecstasy, single lines of
fragments of poems sufficed to produce it. Once
the mystic Taury found himself in the midst of a
company who were discussing some scientific question.
All took part in it with the exception of Taury, who
suddenly rose and recited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem0">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many cooing doves mourn in the mid-day heat,</span>
<span class="i0">Sadly under the roof of foliage overhead,</span>
<span class="i0">Remembering old companions and days gone by;</span>
<span class="i0">Their lament awakens my sorrow also,</span>
<span class="i0">My mourning rouses them, and often theirs disturbs my sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">I do not understand their cooing, and they do not understand my weeping:</span>
<span class="i0">But through, my sorrow of heart I know them, and through their heart-sorrow they know me.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hardly had those present heard these verses than they
all fell into a state of ecstatic contemplation.</p>

<p>Ibrahim ben Adham, the celebrated Sufi, once heard
the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem0">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Everything is forgiven thee, except estrangement from Us:</span>
<span class="i0">We pardon thee all the past, and only that remains which has escaped Our eyes (<i>i.e.</i>, nothing).</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>They immediately caused him to fall into a trance
which lasted twenty-four hours. Ghazzali, who himself
borrowed much from the Sufis, and was a diligent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
student of their doctrine, seeks to explain these strange
phenomena on psychological grounds. He divides
the ecstatic conditions which the hearing of poetical
recitations produces into four classes. The first,
which is the lowest, is that of the simple sensuous
delight in melody. The second class is that of pleasure
in the melody and of understanding the words in their
apparent sense. The third class consists of those who
apply the meaning of the words to the relations between
man and God. To this class belongs the would-be
initiate into Sufism; he has necessarily a goal marked
out for him to aim at, and this goal is the knowledge
of God, meeting Him and union with Him by the way
of secret contemplation, and the removal of the veil
which conceals Him. In order to compass this aim the
Sufi has a special path to follow; he must perform
various ascetic practices and overcome certain spiritual
obstacles in doing so. Now when, during the recitation
of poetry, the Sufi hears mention made of blame or
praise, of acceptance or refusal, of union with the
Beloved or separation from Him, of lament over a
departed joy or longing for a look, as often occurs in
Arabic poetry, one or the other of these accords with
his spiritual state and acts upon him, like a spark
,on tinder, to set his heart aflame. Longing and love
overpower him and unfold to him manifold vistas of
spiritual experience.</p>

<p>The fourth and highest class is that of the fully
initiated who have passed through the stages above-mentioned,
and whose minds are closed to everything
except God. Such an one is wholly denuded of self,
so that he no longer knows his own experiences and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
practices, and, as though with senses sealed, sinks into
the ocean of the contemplation of God. This condition
the Sufis characterise as self-annihilation (Fana).</p>

<p>But he who is bereft of self-consciousness is none the
less aware of what is without him; it is as
if his consciousness were withdrawn from everything
but the one object of contemplation, <i>i.e.</i>, God. While
he who is completely absorbed in the contemplation
of the object seen is as little capable of theorising
regarding the act of contemplation as regarding the
eye, the instrument of sight, or the heart, the seat of
joyful emotion. Just in the same way a drunken
man is not conscious of his intoxication, so he who
is drowned in joy knows nothing of joy itself, but only
knows what causes it. Such a condition of mind may
occur with regard to created things as well as with
regard to the Creator Himself, only in the latter case
it is like a flash of lightning, without permanence.
Could such a condition of the soul last longer, it would
be beyond the power of human nature to endure and
would end in overwhelming it. So it is related of
Taury that once in a meeting he heard this verse
recited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In my love to Thee I attained to a height where to tread causes the senses to reel.</p></div>

<p>He immediately fell into an ecstatic condition and
ran into a field where the newly-cut stubble cut his
feet like knives. Here he ran about all night till the
morning, and a few days afterwards died.</p>

<p>In this highest condition of ecstasy the soul is to be
compared to a clear mirror, which, itself colourless,
reflects the colours of the object seen in it. Or to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
crystal, whose colour is that of the object on which it
stands or of the fluid which it contains. Itself colourless,
it has the property of transmitting colours. This
exposition of Sufistic ecstasy by Ghazzali shows that
in his time, far from being on the wane, such phenomena
were on the increase. For when a man of such comprehensive
mind, such a deep thinker, so well versed in the
knowledge of men and especially of his fellow-Moslems,
speaks so plainly and without doubt upon the matter
and seeks to explain it psychologically, this idea must
have already taken deep root and spread widely.
Ghazzali is consequently to be regarded as a decided
adherent of Sufism and as approving of the enthusiastic
tendencies accompanying it. He narrates in his autobiography<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
how he left his family in Bagdad and went
to Damascus, where for two whole years he studied
Sufism. Afterwards he made the pilgrimage to Mecca
and Medina. In his lonely musings things were revealed
to him, which, he said, could not be described, and
he arrived at last at the firm conviction that the Sufis
were on the way of God and that their teaching was the
best. It must be admitted that by Sufism Ghazzali
meant that kind of it which held fast to the general
principles of Islam and was in accord, even though
only externally, with the orthodox party. These
Sufis adhered to the Koran and the traditions, but
interpreted them allegorically. Mysticism must always
be propped up by a positive religion, as it has no support
in itself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>HASAN BASRI<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a><br />
<span class="smcap">(d 728 ad)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4>


<p>Hasan Basri was born in Arabia at Medina, where
his mother had been brought as a captive and sold to
Omm Salma, one of the wives of the Prophet. Arrived
at man's estate, and having received his liberty, he
retired to Basra on the Persian gulf, a stronghold of
the ascetic sect. Here he lived undisturbed, though his
open disavowal of the reigning family of Ommeyah
exposed him to some danger. The following incident,
illustrating his independence of character is narrated
by Ibn Khalliqan. When Omar ibn Hubaira was
appointed to the government of Irak in the reign of
the Caliph Abd-al Malik (<span class="smcap">a.d. 721</span>) he called for Hasan
Basri, Muhammad Ibn Sirin and as Shabi to whom he
said, "Abd al Malik has received my promise that
I will hear and obey him; and he has now appointed
me to what you see, and I receive from him written
orders. Must I obey him in whatever orders he takes
upon himself to give?" To this Ibn Sirin and as Shabi
gave a cautious reply, but Hasan Basri, being asked
his opinion, made this answer: "O Ibn Hubaira!
God outweighs Abd al Malik, and Abd al Malik cannot
outweigh God; God can defend thee from Abd al
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>Malik, and Abd al Malik cannot defend thee from God.
He will soon send an angel to take thee from thy throne,
and send thee from the width of thy palace into the
narrowness of the tomb. Then thy deeds alone can
save thee." Ibn Hubaira then rewarded them, but
bestowed a double reward on Hasan Basri, upon which
as Shabi said to Ibn Sirin, "We gave him a poor answer,
and he gave us a poor reward."</p>

<p>Hasan Basri's adoption of the ascetic life was brought
about in the following way. When a young man he
was a lapidary, and had gone to Roum (Asia Minor)
to practise his craft. He there lived on friendly terms
with the vizier of that country. One day the vizier
said to him, "We are going out of the city to a certain
place; will you come with us?" Hasan Basri
assented, and went. "We came," he said afterwards,
"to a plain where there was a vast tent the ropes of
which were of silk and its stakes of gold. I saw a large
number of soldiers marching round it; they repeated
some words which I could not hear, and then retired.
Then came about four hundred mullahs and learned
men, who did the same. These were followed by a
similar number of old men. Then about four or five
hundred beautiful maidens, each holding in her hand
a dish containing rubies, pearls, turquoises, and other
precious stones. They went in procession round
the tent in the same way. Finally the sultan and the
vizier went into the tent and came out again.</p>

<p>"As for me, I remained transfixed with astonishment.
'What does all this mean?' I asked the vizier. 'The
King,' he said, 'had an extremely beautiful child of a
happy disposition, who fell ill and died. His tomb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
is within this tent, and they visit it once a year. First
come the soldiers, who circle round the tent and say,
'O son of the sultan, if we could have ransomed thy
life by the strokes of our swords, we would have done
it, even had it cost us our own; but God willed otherwise,
and we cannot change his decree.' Having so
said, they go away. Then the mullahs and learned
men, coming in their turn, say, 'O son of the sultan,
if we could have ransomed thee by knowledge or by
eloquence, we would have done so; but all the knowledge
and eloquence in the world cannot arrest the
decrees of Allah.' Then they depart. After them
come the old men, who cry, 'If we could have saved
thee by groanings and prayers, we would have done so;
but our intercession is useless.' Finally come the
young maidens, who say, 'O son of the sultan, if
we could have ransomed thee at the price of beauty
and wealth, we would have done it; but the steps
of fate turn aside for neither.' After them the sultan
and the vizier enter the tent. The sultan says, 'O my
son, I have done all that I could do. I have brought
all these soldiers, these mullahs, these learned men,
these old men, these beautiful maidens bearing treasures,
and yet I cannot bring thee back. It depends not
on me, but on Him before Whom all power is powerless.
May the mercy of the Lord be multiplied upon thee
for another year.' Having thus spoken, they return
by the way they came.'"</p>

<p>Hasan Basri, having heard this, felt stirred to the
depths of his heart. Leaving Roum, he retired to
Basra, where he took an oath that he would not smile
again till he knew what his eternal destiny would be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
He practised the severest asceticism, and many came
to hear him preach.</p>

<p>Hasan Basri had a disciple who was in the habit of
casting himself on the ground and uttering groans
when he heard the Koran recited. "If thou art able
to restrain these groans," said he, "they will prove
like a destructive fire to thee; but if they are really
beyond thy power to control, I declare that I am
six stages behind thee in the way of piety. Such
groanings," he added, "are generally the work of
Satan."</p>

<p>One day Hasan Basri was preaching when Hejaj
ben Yusuf, the bloodthirsty and formidable governor
of Irak, accompanied by a great number of his retinue
with drawn swords, entered the mosque. A person
of distinction in the audience said, "We must watch
to-day whether Hasan will be embarrassed by the
presence of Hejaj." When the latter had taken his
place, Hasan Basri, without paying the least attention
to him, so far from shortening his discourse, prolonged
it. When it was finished, the person who was watching
him exclaimed, "Bravo, Hasan!" When he came
down from the pulpit, Hejaj came forward, and, taking
him by the hand, said, addressing the people, "If
you wish to see him whom the Lord has distinguished
among you, come and look on Hasan Basri."</p>

<p>Hasan had in his heart such a fear of the Lord that,
like a man seated near an executioner, he was always
in a state of apprehension. Seeing one day a man
who wept, he asked him what was the matter. "To-day,"
answered the man, "I heard a preacher say
that there were a great many among the Moslems who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
by reason of their sins would remain several years in
hell, and then be taken out." "May God grant,"
cried Hasan, "that I be one of those who come out
of hell at last; may I be even as that man, who, as
the prophet of God said, will come out eighty-four
years after all the rest."</p>

<p>One night he was overheard weeping and groaning
in his house. "Why these tears and laments?" he
was asked. "I weep," he answered, "thinking that
perhaps to-day I have set my foot in an unlawful
place, or allowed an evil word to escape my lips which
will cause me to be chased from before the throne of
the most high. 'Away!' it will be said to me;
'thou hast no access here, thy works of piety are not
accepted.' And what answer shall I make? Behold
the reason of my fear." One of his sayings was, "I
never saw a certainty of which there is no doubt bear
a greater resemblance to a doubtful thing of which there
is no certainty than death does."</p>

<p>Hasan Basri had a neighbour named Shamaun,
who was an infidel and a fire-worshipper. He fell ill,
and his last hour approached. Some one said to
Hasan, "Shamaun is your neighbour, and his last
hour is come; why don't you go to see him?" Hasan
having come to see him, saw that by reason of his
assiduous fire-worship, his hair and beard were quite
blackened by smoke. Hoping that he would become
a Moslem, he said to him, "Come, Shamaun, fear the
punishment which the Lord prepares for thee who
hast passed thy life of seventy years in infidelity and
fire-worship." "As for me," answered Shamaun,
"I see on the part of you Moslems three characteristics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
which I cannot explain, and which hinder me from
becoming a Moslem:&mdash;(1) You never cease repeating
that the world is perishable and impure, and yet day
and night, without interval or repose, you heap up
its treasures; (2) You say that death is certain and
inevitable, and yet you put the thought of it aside,
and practise none of the works which should fit you
for another world; (3) You assert your belief that in
that world it will be possible to contemplate the face
of the Most High, and yet you commit acts which He
abhors." "Thou speakest like one of the initiated,"
said Hasan, "but although the faithful commit sins,
none the less they confess the unity and the existence
of the Most High, whilst thou hast spent thy life in
worshipping the fire. At the day of judgment, if they
cast us both into hell, the fire will carry thee away at
once, but if the grace of the Lord is accorded to me,
it will not be able to scorch one of my eyebrows; this
shows that it is only a creature. And, moreover, you
have worshipped it for seventy years, and I have never
worshipped it."</p>

<p>These words made such an impression on Shamaun
that he made a profession of the faith of Islam, dying
soon afterwards. On the night of his death, Hasan in
a dream saw Shamaun wearing a crown of gold, clothed
in raiment of resplendent beauty, and walking in
Paradise. "My God," he cried when he awoke,
"Thou hast had mercy on him who spent seventy
years in infidelity; is it strange that Thou shouldest
show mercy to the faithful?"</p>

<p>Hasan was a man of such humility of mind that he
considered everyone whom he saw his superior. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
day when he was walking along the bank of the river
Tigris he saw a negro seated near a woman; before
them was a jar and a cup. Each of them in turn
poured from the jar into the cup and drank. Seeing
this man, Hasan, according to his wont, said to himself,
"There is a man better than myself." At the same
time he secretly thought, "As regards the observance of
the ceremonial law, it is possible that he is not superior
to me, for he is sitting near a woman of doubtful character
and drinking wine." While he was thus reflecting,
there appeared on the river a boat heavily laden, and
containing seven persons. Just as it was approaching
the shore, it foundered. The negro, casting himself
into the water, drew out six persons in succession;
then, going to Hasan, he said to him, "Rise, if thou art
better than I. I have saved six, for my part; thou
save one, for thine." Then he added, "O true believers,
this jar contains water, and this woman is my mother.
I have wished to tempt Hasan." Then, addressing
the latter, he said, "See, thou hast looked with the
outer eye only, and hast not been capable of looking
with the inner eye." At these words, Hasan, falling
at his feet, kissed his hand, and understood that he
was one of the Lord's chosen servants. "Sir," he
said, "as thou hast drawn these drowning men from
the water so save me from the abyss of self-worship."
The negro replied, "Go, thou art saved." From that
time Hasan considered no one smaller than himself,
but everyone his superior.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Hasan Basri said, "I have been
startled by the sayings of four persons, (1) a drunkard,
(2) a debauchee, (3) a child, (4) a woman." "How was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
that?" he was asked. "One day," he said, "I saw
a drunkard staggering in the midst of the mire. I said
to him, 'Try and walk so as not to stumble.' 'O Hasan,'
the drunkard replied, 'in spite of all your efforts, do
<i>you</i> walk firmly in the way of God? Tell me, yes or no.
If I fall in the mire no great harm is done, I can get rid
of it by washing; but if you fall into the pit of self-conceit,
you will never emerge clean and your eternal
welfare will be entirely ruined.' These words pierced
me to the heart. (2) Again, as I passed once close
to a man of infamous character, I drew my robes close
about me lest they should touch him. 'O Hasan,' he
said, 'why draw thy robes away from contact with me.
Only the Most High knows what will be the end of each.'
(3) Another time I saw a child coming towards me holding
a lighted torch in his hand. 'Where have you brought
this light from?' I asked him. He immediately
blew it out, and said to me, 'O Hasan, tell me where
it is gone, and I will tell you whence I fetched it.'
(4) One day a beautiful woman, with her face
unveiled, came to me. She had just been quarrelling
with her husband, and no sooner had she met me
than she began reporting his words. 'O woman,'
I said, 'first cover thy face and then speak.' 'O
Hasan,' she answered, 'In my excitement I lost
reason, and I did not even know that my face was
uncovered. If you had not told me I should have
gone thus into the bazaar. But you who with so
great zeal cultivate the friendship of the Most High,
ought you not to curb your eye, so as not to see
whether my face was uncovered or not?' Her
words sank deeply into my heart."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>One day Hasan said to his friends, "You are like
the companions of the prophet, on whom be peace."
They felt immensely gratified at this, but he added,
"I mean your faces and beards are like theirs, but
nothing else in you. If you had seen them, such was
their absorption in divine things, you would have
thought them mad. Had they seen you, they would
not have regarded one of you as a real Moslem. They,
in the practice of the faith, were like horsemen mounted
on swift steeds, or like the wind, or like the bird which
cleaves the air; while we progress like men mounted on
donkeys with sores on their backs."</p>

<p>An Arab visiting Hasan Basri asked him for a definition
of patience. Hasan answered, "There are two
kinds of patience; one kind consists in bearing afflictions
and calamities bravely and in abstaining from what the
Lord has forbidden, the other kind consists in never
lending an ear to the suggestions of Satan." "As for
me," said the Arab, "I have never seen anyone more
retiring from the world and more patient than thyself."
"Alas," answered Hasan, "my renouncement of the
world and my patience count as nothing." "Why
dost thou say so?" exclaimed the Arab. "Because,
if I practise renouncement it is only from dread of hell-fire,
and if I keep patient it is only because I hope to
enter Paradise. Now that man alone deserves to be
taken into account who, without self-regarding motives
practises patience for the sake of the Most High,
and whose renouncement of the world has not
Paradise for its object, but only the desire to please
God. Such a way of acting is a manifest sign of
sincerity of heart."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>Asked on another occasion what his spiritual state
was like, Hasan replied, "My state is like that of a
man shipwrecked in the sea, who is clinging to a solitary
plank."</p>

<p>He never laughed. At the moment of death he
smiled once, and called out "What sin? What sin?"
Someone saw him after his death in a dream, and asked
him, "O Hasan Basri, thou who never wert in the habit
of smiling, why, when dying, didst thou say with a
smile, 'What sin? What sin?'" Hasan answered,
"When I was dying I heard a voice which said, 'O
Azrael, hold back his soul a little longer, it has still one
sin,' and in my joy I exclaimed, 'What sin?'"</p>

<p>The night of his death another of his friends had a
dream, in which he saw the gates of heaven open and
heard a voice proclaim, "Hasan Basri has come to his
Lord, Who is satisfied with him."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>RABIA, THE WOMAN SUFI</h4>


<p>Rabia, the daughter of Ismail, a woman celebrated for
her holy life, and a native of Basra, belonged to the
tribe of Adi. Al Qushairi says in his treatise on Sufism,
"She used to say when holding converse with God,
'Consume with fire O God, a presumptuous heart
which loveth Thee.' On one of these occasions a
voice spoke to her and said, 'That we shall not do.
Think not of us an ill thought.' Often in the silence
of the night she would go on the roof of her house and
say, 'The lover is now with his beloved, but I rejoice in
being alone with Thee.'"</p>

<p>When Rabia grew up her father and mother died.
At that time there was a famine in Basra. She came
into the possession of an evil man, who sold her as a
slave. The master who bought her treated her hardly,
and exacted all kinds of menial services from her. One
day, when she was seeking to avoid the rude gaze of a
stranger, she slipped on the path and fell, breaking her
wrist. Lying there with her face to the ground, she
said "Lord, I am far from my own, a captive and
an orphan, and my wrist has just been broken, and yet
none of these things grieve me. Only this one thought
causes me disquiet; it is that I know not if Thou art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
satisfied with me." She then heard a voice, "Vex not
thyself, O Rabia, for at the day of Resurrection We shall
give thee such a rank that the angels nearest Us shall
envy thee." Rabia went home with her heart at peace.</p>

<p>One night, Rabia's master being awake, heard the
sound of her voice. He perceived Rabia with her head
bent, saying, "My Lord, Thou knowest that the desire
of my heart is to seek Thy approbation, and that
its only wish is to obey Thy commands. If I had liberty
of action, I would not remain a single instant without
doing Thee service; but Thou hast delivered me into
the hands of a creature, and therefore I am hindered in
the same." Her master said to himself that it was
not possible any longer to treat her as a slave, and as
soon as daybreak appeared, he said to her, "O Rabia,
I make thee free. If thou desirest, remain here, and
we shall be at thy service. If thou dost not wish to
to stay here, go whithersoever it pleaseth thee."</p>

<p>Then Rabia departed from them and devoted herself
entirely to works of piety. One day when she was
making the pilgrimage to the Kaaba<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> she halted in
the desert and exclaimed, "My God, my heart is a
prey to perplexity in the midst of this solitude. I am
a stone, and so is the Kaaba; what can it do for me?
That which I need is to contemplate Thy face." At
these words a voice came from the Most High, "O Rabia,
wilt thou bear alone that which the whole world cannot?
When Moses desired to see Our Face we showed It to
a mountain, which dissolved into a thousand fragments."</p>

<p>Abda, the servant maid of Rabia, relates as follows,
"Rabia used to pass the whole night in prayer, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>at morning dawn she took a light sleep in her oratory
till daylight, and I have heard her say when she sprang
in dread from her couch, 'O my soul, how long wilt
thou sleep? Soon thou shalt sleep to rise no more, till
the call shall summon thee on the day of resurrection.'"</p>

<p>Hasan Basri once asked Rabia if she ever thought of
marrying. She answered, "The marriage contract can
be entered into by those who have possession of their
free-will. As for me, I have no will to dispose of; I
belong to the Lord, and I rest in the shadow of His
commandments, counting myself as nothing." "But,"
said Hasan, "how have you arrived at such a degree
of piety?" "By annihilating myself completely."</p>

<p>Being asked on another occasion why she did not
marry, she answered, "There are three things which
cause me anxiety." "And what are they?" "One
is to know whether at the moment of death I shall be
able to take my faith with me intact. The second is
whether in the Day of Resurrection the register of
my actions will be placed in my right hand or not.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
The third is to know, when some are led to Paradise
and some to hell, in which direction I shall be led."
"But," they cried, "none of us know any of these things."
"What!" she answered, "when I have such objects to
pre-occupy my mind, should I think of a husband?"</p>

<p>Someone asked her one day, "Whence comest
thou?" "From the other world," was her reply.
"And whither goest thou?" "Into the other world."
"And what doest thou in this world." "I jest with it
by eating its bread and doing the works of the other
world in it." "O Rabia," said another to her, "dost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>thou love the Lord?" "Truly," she replied, "I love
Him." "And dost thou regard Satan as an enemy?"
"I love the Lord so much," she answered, "that I do
not trouble myself about the enmity of Satan."</p>

<p>One night she saw the Prophet (on whom be peace)
in a dream. He saluted her and said, "Rabia, lovest
thou me?" "O Prophet of God," she replied, "is
there anyone who does not love thee? Yet the love
of the Most High fills my heart to such a degree that
there is no room for love or hatred towards anyone
else."</p>

<p>On one occasion she was asked, "Dost thou see Him
Whom thou servest?" "If I did not see Him," she
said, "I would not serve Him." She was frequently
found in tears, and, being asked the reason why, replied,
"I fear that at the last moment a Voice may cry, 'Rabia
is not worthy to appear in Our court.'" The following
question was put to her, "If one of His servants truly
repents, will the Lord accept it or not?" "As long
as God does not grant repentance," she replied, "how
can anyone repent? And if He does grant it, there is
no doubt that he will accept it."</p>

<p>Once when Rabia had immured herself for a long
while in her house without coming forth, her servant
said to her, "Lady, come forth out of this house and
contemplate the works of the Most High." "Nay,"
said Rabia, "enter rather into thyself and contemplate
His work in thyself." Having kept a strict fast for
seven days and nights in order to give herself to prayer,
on the eighth night she seemed to hear her emaciated
body say, "O Rabia, how long wilt thou torture me
without mercy?" Whilst she was holding this soliloquy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
with herself, suddenly someone knocked at the door,
and a man brought in some food in a bowl. Rabia
took it and set it down; then while she went to light
the lamp, a cat came and ate the food. No sooner had
Rabia returned and seen what had happened than she
said to herself, "I will break my fast on water." As
she went to draw water her lamp went out. She then
uttered a deep sigh, and said, "Lord, why dost thou
make me wretched?" Whereupon she heard a voice
saying, "O Rabia, if thou desirest it, I will give thee
the whole world for thine own; but I shall have to take
away the love which thou hast for Me from thy heart,
for the love of Me and of the world cannot exist together."
"Hearing myself thus addressed," said Rabia, "I
entirely expelled from my heart the love of earthly
things, and resolutely turned my gaze away from them.
For thirty years I have not prayed without saying to
myself, 'This prayer, perhaps, is the last which I shall
pray,' and I have never been tired of saying, 'My God,
let me be so absorbed in Thy love that no other affection
may find room in my heart.'"</p>

<p>One day some men of learning and piety came to her
and said, "The Most High has crowned His chosen
saints with the gift of performing miracles, but such
privileges have never been granted to a woman. How
didst thou attain to such a high degree?" "What
you say is true," she answered, "but, on the other
hand, women have never been so infatuated with themselves
as men, nor have they ever claimed divinity."</p>

<p>Hasan Basri relates, "One day when I had been to
Rabia who had fallen sick, to ask after her, I saw seated
at her gate a merchant who wept. 'Why are you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
weeping?' I asked him. 'I have just brought for
Rabia,' he answered, 'this purse of gold, and I am
troubled in mind, not knowing whether she will accept
it or not. Go in Hasan, and ask whether she will.'
Then I went in, and no sooner had I reported to her
the words of this merchant than she said to me, 'Thou
knowest well, O Hasan, that the Most High gives daily
bread even to those who do not worship Him; how
then will He not give it to those whose hearts are aglow
with love to Him? Besides, ever since I have known
God, I have turned my eyes away from all except Him.
How can I accept anyone's money when I know not
whether it has been gained by lawful or unlawful means?
Present then my excuses to this merchant, and let
him go.'"</p>

<p>Another merchant visiting Rabia found her house in
ill repair. He presented her with a new house. Rabia
had no sooner entered it than, seeing paintings on the
wall, she became absorbed in contemplating them.
Recovering herself, she quitted the house, and refused
to re-enter it, saying, "I fear lest my heart may become
attached to this house to such a degree that I neglect
preparation for the other world."</p>

<p>One day Abdul Wahid and Sofi&acirc;n Tsavri went to see
Rabia in her illness. They were so touched by the sight
of her weakness that for some moments they could not
speak a word. At last Sofi&acirc;n said, "O Rabia, pray
that the Lord may lighten thy sufferings." "O Sofi&acirc;n,"
she answered, "who has sent me these sufferings?"
"The Most High," he said. "Very well," she replied,
"if it is his will that this trial come upon me, how can
I, ignoring His will, ask Him to remove it?" "Rabia,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
said Sofi&acirc;n, "I am not capable of talking to thee about
thy own affairs; talk to me about mine." "Well,"
answered Rabia, "if thou hadst not an inclination to
this low world, thou wouldst be a man without fault."
"Then," relates Sofi&acirc;n, "I cried with tears, 'My God,
canst Thou be satisfied with me?'" "O Sofi&acirc;n,"
said Rabia, "dost thou not blush at saying to the Lord,
'Canst Thou be satisfied with me?' without having
done a single thing to please him?"</p>

<p>Malik Dinar recounts the following: "I went to see
Rabia, and found her drinking water out of a broken
pitcher. She was lying stretched on an old mat, with
a brick for her pillow. I was pierced to the heart
at the sight, and said, "O Rabia, I have rich
friends; if you will let me, I will go and ask them for
something for you." "You have spoken ill, Malik,"
she replied; 'it is the Lord who, to them as to me, gives
daily bread. He Who provides for the needs of the
rich, shall He not provide for the necessities of the poor?
If He wills that it should be thus with us, we shall
gladly submit to His will.'"</p>

<p>On one occasion when Malik Dinar, Hasan Basri and
Shaqiq were with her, the conversation turned on
sincerity of heart towards God. Hasan Basri said,
"He has not sincere love to God who does not bear
with constancy the afflictions which the Lord sends
him." "That remark savours of self-conceit," said
Rabia. Shaqiq observed, "He is not sincere who does
not render thanks for afflictions." "There is a higher
degree of sincerity than that," said Rabia. Malik Dinar
suggested, "He is not sincere who does not find
delight in the afflictions which the Lord sends." "That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
is not the purest sincerity," she remarked. Then they
asked her to define sincerity. She said, "He is not
sincere who does not forget the pain of affliction through
his absorption in God."</p>

<p>One of the learned theologians of Basra, once visiting
Rabia, began to enlarge upon the defects of the world.
"You must be very fond of the world," said Rabia,
"for if you were not, you would not talk so much
about it. He who really intends to buy something
keeps on discussing it. If you were really disentangled
from it, what would you care about its merits or its
faults?"</p>

<p>Other sayings of Rabia were these, "My God, if on
the day of judgment Thou sendest me to hell, I shall
reveal a secret which will make hell fly far from me."
"O Lord, give all Thou destinest for me of the goods
of this world to Thy enemies, and all that Thou reservest
for me in Paradise to Thy friends, for it is Thou only
Whom I seek." "My God, if it is from fear of hell that
I serve Thee, condemn me to burn in hell; and if it
is for the hope of Paradise, forbid me entrance there;
but if it is for Thy sake only, deny me not the sight of
Thy face."</p>

<p>Rabia died <span class="smcap">a.d. 752</span>, and was buried near Jerusalem.
Her tomb was a centre of pilgrimage during the Middle
Ages.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>IBRAHIM BEN ADHAM PRINCE OF BALKH<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 875)</span></h4>


<p>Ibrahim Ben Adham was originally Prince of the
city of Balkh, and had control of the riches of many
provinces. One night when he was in bed he heard
a sound of footsteps on the roof of his palace. "Who
are you on the roof?" he cried out. An answer came,
"I have lost a camel, and I am looking for it on this
roof." "Well," he said, "you must be a fool for
your pains, to look for a camel on a roof." "And thou,
witless man," returned the voice, "is it while seated
on a throne of gold that thou expectest to find the
Most High? That is far madder than to seek a camel
on a roof." At these words, fear seized the heart of
Ibrahim, who spent the rest of the night in prayer,
till the early dawn. The next morning he took his
seat upon his throne, round which were ranged all
the grandees of his kingdom and his guards, according
to their rank, in the usual manner. All of a sudden
Ibrahim perceived in the midst of the crowd a majestic
figure, who advanced towards him unseen by the rest.
When he had come near, Ibrahim asked him, "Who
art thou, and what hast thou come to seek here?"
"I am a stranger," he answered, "and I wish to stay
at this inn." "But this is not an inn," answered
Ibrahim, "it is my own house." "To whom did it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
belong before thee?" inquired the stranger. "To my
father." "And before thy father, to whom did it
belong?" "To my grandfather." "And where are
thy ancestors now?" "They are dead." "Well
then, is this house anything but an hotel, where the
coming guest succeeds to the departing one?" So
saying, the stranger began to withdraw. Ibrahim rose,
ran toward him, and said, "I adjure thee to stop, in
the name of the Most High." The stranger paused.
"Who art thou," cried Ibrahim, "who hast lit this
fire in my soul?" "I am Khizr, O Ibrahim. It is
time for thee to awake." So saying, he disappeared.
Ibrahim, pierced with sorrow, awoke from his trance,
and felt a keen disdain for all earthly grandeur.</p>

<p>The next morning, being mounted and going to the
chase, he heard a voice which said, "O Ibrahim, thou
wast not created for this." He looked round him on
all sides, but could see no one, and went on again.
Presently again the voice was heard, proceeding, as
it were, from his saddle, "O Ibrahim, thou wast not
created for this." Struck to the heart, Ibrahim exclaimed,
"It is the Lord who commands; His servant
will obey." He thereupon dismounted, exchanged
clothes with a shepherd whom he discovered close by,
and began to lead the life of a wandering dervish,
and became famous for his devoutness and austerity.</p>

<p>After some years, he undertook the pilgrimage to
Mecca, and joined a caravan which was bound thither.
The news of his coming having reached the chief men
of the city, they all came out to meet him. Some of
their servants, going on, met Ibrahim (whom, of course,
they did not know), and asked him if Ibrahim ben<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Adham was approaching. "Why do you ask me?"
he said. "Because the chief men of the city are come
out to meet him." "And why make so much ado
about that man," he said, "who is a sinner and an
infidel?" "What right hast thou to speak thus of
him?" they cried; and, seizing him, handled him
roughly. After having beaten him they went on their
way. Ibrahim said to himself, "Thou hast had thy
deserts." When he was recognised afterwards, an
ample apology was made to him, and he was conducted
to Mecca, where he remained several years, supporting
himself by money earned by his daily toil.</p>

<p>When Ibrahim left Balkh, he had a son who was then
a child. When the latter became a young man, he
asked, "Where is my father?" Whereupon his mother
told him all that had occurred to his father. "Well,"
said the youth, "where is he to be found now?" "At
Mecca," his mother answered. "Very well, I will go to
Mecca," he replied, "and find my father." He set out,
and when he arrived there, he found in the sacred
precinct surrounding the Kaaba many fakirs clothed
with rags. "Do you know Ibrahim ben Adham?" he
asked them. "He is one of ourselves," one of them
answered; "he has gone to gather and sell wood wherewith
to buy bread and bring it us." The younger
Ibrahim immediately went out of the city to seek his
father. Presently he found an old man carrying a
bundle of wood on his head, whom he recognised as his
father. At this sight he was near weeping, but controlled
himself, and walked behind him unobserved.</p>

<p>As for Ibrahim ben Adham, he carried his wood to
the bazaar, sold it, and bought bread, which he took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
to his fellow-fakirs, and then performed his devotions.
On the other hand, his son did not disclose himself,
for he feared that to do so suddenly would cause his
father to fly.</p>

<p>The next morning one of Ibrahim ben Adham's
fellow-fakirs rose and went to his son's tent. He found
the young man reading the Koran and weeping. The
fakir advanced and saluted him, asking, "Who art
thou? Whence comest thou? Whose son art thou?"
"I am the son of Ibrahim ben Adham," replied the
young man, "and I was never able to see my father
until now; but I fear that if I make myself known to
him, he will repulse me brusquely and flee away."
"Come," said the fakir, "I will myself lead you to him."</p>

<p>Without further delay the wife and son of Ibrahim
joined the fakir, and went to seek him. No sooner
had his wife perceived him than she uttered a cry and
said, "My son, behold thy father." All the bystanders
burst into tears, while Ibrahim's son fell down in a
swoon. When he came to himself he saluted his father,
who returned his greeting, embraced him, and said,
"O my son, of what religion art thou?" "Of the
religion of Muhammad," he answered. "God be
praised!" exclaimed Ibrahim. Then he asked, "Dost
thou know the Koran?" "I know it," was the reply.
"Dost thou read the books which treat of religious
knowledge?" "I read them." "God be praised!"
again exclaimed Ibrahim. Then he prepared to leave
them and depart, but his wife and son would not let
him, and began to weep. But Ibrahim, lifting up his
eyes to heaven, prayed, "My God, come to my help,"
on which his son immediately died. The companions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of Ibrahim asked him, "What is the meaning of this?"
"When I saw my son," he answered, "my paternal
tenderness was aroused. But immediately I heard a
voice, 'What, Ibrahim! Dost thou pretend attachment
to Us while all the while thy heart is engaged
with another person? How can two loves co-exist
in one heart?' On hearing this, I prayed to the Lord
and said, 'O my God, if my love to this child makes
Thee withdraw from me, take his soul or mine.' My
prayer was heard, and He has taken the soul of my
son." On one occasion Ibrahim is reported to have
said, "Many nights in succession I sought to find the
Kaaba unoccupied. One night when it was raining
very hard, I at last found it so. I entered it, and
lifting my heart to God, I said, 'O God, blot out my
sins,' upon which I heard a Voice, which said, 'O
Ibrahim, all over the world men ask Us the same thing;
but if We blot out everyone's sins, whom shall We cause
to share in the ocean of Our mercy?'" On another
occasion he was asked, "Why hast thou given up thy
rank and thy kingdom?" "One day," he said,
"When I was seated on my throne, I looked at a mirror.
I saw reflected in it my last resting-place, which was
an obscure tomb, wherein I had no one to keep me
company. The road whereby to reach the other
world was long, nay infinite, and I had no provision
for the way. I saw besides an upright judge, who
questioned me so rigorously that I could return him
no fit answer. Behold why my rank and my kingdom
lost all value in my eyes, and why I abandoned them."
"But why," continued the questioner, "didst thou
flee Khorasan?" "Because," he said, "they kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
on questioning me." "And why dost thou not
marry?" "Is there any woman who would marry
a man like myself, who am always hungry and naked?
If I could, I would divorce myself; how then can I
attach anyone to myself?"</p>

<p>Once Ibrahim asked a dervish, "Have you a wife and
children?" "No," answered the dervish. "It is all then
well for thee." "Why so?" asked the dervish. "Because,"
said Ibrahim, "everytime a dervish marries he is like
one who embarks on a vessel, but when children are
born to him he is like one who is drowning."</p>

<p>Seeing a dervish groaning, he said, "Doubtless thou
hast bought this position of dervish at a low price."
"What, Ibrahim," answered the other, "can the position
of dervish be bought?" "Certainly," answered
Ibrahim; "I have bought it at the price of royalty,
and I find I have made a good bargain."</p>

<p>One day a man brought to Ibrahim a sum of a thousand
pieces of gold, which he had vowed to offer him. "I do
not take anything from the wretched," the latter said.
"But," said the other, "I am a rich man." "What,"
answered Ibrahim, "you are as rich as that, and still
seek to increase your wealth?" "As a matter of
fact, I do." "Well then, you are more wretched than
anyone," and he added, "Listen! I possess nothing,
and I ask nothing of anyone. I have aspired after
the condition of a dervish and found riches in it;
others have aspired after riches and found poverty."
Another person also offered Ibrahim a thousand pieces
of gold, which he refused, saying, "You wish doubtless
by means of this gold to erase my name from the list
of dervishes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>Every day Ibrahim worked for hire, and whatever
he earned he spent on provisions to take to his companions;
then they all broke their fast together. He
never returned in any case till he had performed his
evening devotions. One day when he had been absorbed
in them, he returned later than usual. His
companions, who were waiting for him, said to themselves,
"We had better break our fast and all go to
bed. When Ibrahim sees what we have done, he will
come earlier another time, and not keep us waiting."
Accordingly, they all ate and lay down. When Ibrahim
came and saw them asleep, he said to himself, "Perhaps
they have gone to bed hungry." He had brought with
him a little meal, which he made into dough; then he
blew up the fire, and cooked supper for his companions.
They then rose and said to him, "What are you doing,
Ibrahim?" "I am cooking something for you, for
it has occurred to me that perhaps you have gone to
bed without taking anything." They looked at each
other, and said, "See, while we were plotting against
him, he was engaged in thinking for us."</p>

<p>One day a man came to Ibrahim and said, "O
Ibrahim, I have done myself a great deal of harm
(by sin). Give me some advice." "Listen then,"
said Ibrahim, "here are six rules for you. First:
When you have committed a sin, do not eat the food
which the Lord sends you." "But I cannot live
without food," said the other. "What!" exclaimed
Ibrahim, "is it just that you should profit by what the
Lord supplies while you do not serve Him and never
cease to offend Him?" Second: "When you are on
the point of committing a sin, quit the Kingdom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Most High." "But," said the man, "His Kingdom
extends from the East to the West; how can I go out
of it?" "Very well, remain in it; but give up sin,
and don't be rebellious." Third: "When you are
about to sin, place thyself where the Most High
cannot see you." "But one cannot hide anything
from Him." "Very well then," said Ibrahim, "is
it right that you should live on what He supplies,
and that you should dwell in His Kingdom, and commit
evil actions under His eyes?" Fourth: "When
Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes to claim your soul,
say to him, 'Give me a respite, I wish to repent.'"
"But how will Azrael listen to such a prayer?" "If it
is so," replied Ibrahim, "repent now, so as not to have
to do so when Azrael comes." Fifth: "When you
are placed in the tomb, dismiss the angels Munkir and
Nakir,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> who will come to examine thee." "But I
cannot." "Very well, live such a life as to be able
to reply satisfactorily to them." Sixth: "On the Day
of Judgment, when the order goes forth to conduct
sinners to hell, say you won't go." "It suffices,
Ibrahim, you have said enough." The man repented,
and the fervour of his conversion lasted till his death.</p>

<p>Ibrahim is said to have told the following story.
"One day I went to glean, but as soon as I put any
ears of corn in the lappet of my robe they were shaken
out. This happened something like forty times. At
last I cried, 'What does this mean, O Lord?' I heard
a Voice say in reply, 'O, Ibrahim, in the time of your
prosperity forty bucklers of red gold were carried in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>front of thee. It was necessary that you should be
thus molested as a requital for the luxury of those
forty golden bucklers.'"</p>

<p>Once Ibrahim was entrusted with the charge of an
orchard. The owner one day came down to visit it,
and told Ibrahim to bring him some sweet pomegranates.
Ibrahim went and gathered the largest he could find,
but they all proved to be bitter. "What!" said the
owner, "you have eaten these pomegranates so long,
and cannot distinguish the sweet from the bitter?"
"Sir," replied Ibrahim, "you told me to take charge
of the orchard, but you did not tell me to eat the pomegranates."
"Ah," replied the other, "to judge by
your austerity, you must be no other than Ibrahim ben
Adham." The latter, seeing that he was discovered,
left the orchard and departed.</p>

<p>A story told by Ibrahim was as follows. "One
night I saw in a dream Gabriel, with a piece of paper
in his hand. 'What are you doing?' I asked him.
'I am writing on this sheet of paper the names of the
friends of the Lord.' 'Will you write mine among
them?' Ibrahim asked. 'But you are not one of His
friends.' 'If I am not one of His friends, at least I
am a friend of His friends.' Immediately a Voice was
heard, 'O Gabriel, write Ibrahim's name on the first
line, for he who loves Our friends is Our friend.'"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>
<p>Once while Ibrahim was walking in the country,
a horseman met him and asked him who he was, "I
am," answered Ibrahim, "the servant of the Most High."
"Well," said the horseman, "direct me to the nearest
dwellings." Ibrahim pointed to the cemetery. "You are
jesting at me," the other cried, and struck him on the
head so severely that the blood began to flow. Then
he tied a cord round his neck, and dragged him forcibly
into the middle of the neighbouring town. The people
cried out "Madman, what are you doing? It is Ibrahim
ben Adham." Immediately the horseman prostrated
himself before Ibrahim and implored his pardon. "O
Ibrahim," he said, "when I asked you where were the
nearest dwellings, why did you point to the cemetery?"
"Every day," he answered, "the cemetery becomes
more and more peopled, while the town and its most
flourishing quarters are continually falling into ruins."</p>

<p>When Ibrahim's last hour arrived, he disappeared
from sight, and no one has been able to say exactly
where his tomb is. Some say it is at Bagdad, others
at Damascus, others at Pentapolis. When he died, a
Voice was heard saying, "The man who excelled all
others in faith is dead; Ibrahim ben Adham has
passed away."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>FUDHAYL BEN AYAZ, THE HIGHWAYMAN<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 803 ad)</span></h4>


<p>In the beginning of his career Fudhayl ben Ayaz was
a highwayman, and used to pitch his tent on the
plains between Merv and Abiwerd. He had collected
many other robbers round him; when they brought
in booty, he, as their chief, apportioned it. He never
neglected saying the Friday prayers, and dismissed
any of his servants whom he found neglecting them.</p>

<p>One day his men were lying in wait on the high road
when a numerous caravan arrived and fell into their
clutches. In this caravan was a merchant who had
a large sum of money in his purse. Desirous of hiding
it, he fled towards the open plain; there he found a
tent and a man clothed in coarse garments seated in it.
The merchant, having explained the matter to him,
was told to leave his money there. He did so, and
returned to the caravan. When he got there he saw
that the robbers had attacked it and taken all the goods,
after having bound and laid on the earth all the travellers.
He ransomed them, and helped them to gather together
the remains of their property. When he returned
to the tent he found the robbers there dividing
their booty. Seeing this, he said, "Woe is me! Then
he whom I trusted my money to was a robber." He
was on the point of departing when Fudhayl called
out to him, "What is the matter?" "I had come,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
he answered, "to take back my money which I had
deposited here." "Well," said Fudhayl, "you will
find it where you placed it." The merchant did so.
"But," cried Fudhayl's companions, "we did not find
any coined money at all in this caravan; how is it
that you hand over such a large sum?" "This man,"
answered Fudhayl, "has trusted me in the simplicity
of his heart; now I, in the simplicity of my heart,
trust in the Lord; and just as I have justified the good
opinion which the merchant had of me, I hope the
Lord will justify that which I have of Him."</p>

<p>The conversion of Fudhayl to an ascetic life took
place in the following manner. As he was climbing
over a wall to see a girl whom he loved, he heard a
voice pronounce this verse of the Koran: "Is not the
time yet come unto those who believe that their hearts
should humbly submit to the admonition of God?"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
On this he exclaimed, "O Lord, that time is come."
He then went away from the place, and the approach
of night induced him to repair for shelter to a ruined
edifice. A caravan was encamped not far off, and
Fudhayl heard one of the travellers say to another,
"We must rise and be going, lest Fudhayl should arrive
and rob us." Fudhayl then came forward and said,
"I have good news for you. Fudhayl has entered
upon the path of penitence, and is more likely to flee
from you than you from him." Then he departed, after
having asked their pardon for his former misdeeds. For
some time he resided at Mecca, where he received instruction
from Abou Hanifeh, and subsequently returned to his
own country, where his sanctity became widespread.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>
<p>It is related that one night the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid
said to Fazl the Barmecide, "Take me to a
man by whose aid I may rise out of the moral torpor
into which I have fallen." Fazl took him to the door
of a celebrated ascetic, Sofyan ibn Oyaina, who asked
on their knocking, "Who is there?" "The Prince
of the Faithful," answered Fazl. "Why did you not
send for me?" said Sofyan, "I would have come myself
in person to serve him." Al-Rashid, hearing this, said,
"This is not the man I seek." They then departed,
and knocked at the door of Fudhayl. As they arrived,
the latter was reciting the following verse of the Koran:
"Do those who have done evil imagine that we shall
set them on the same level with those who have done
well?" Koran (Sura xlv., v. 20). The Caliph had
no sooner heard this verse than he said, "If it is good
advice we are seeking, here is enough for us." Then
they knocked at the door. "Who is there?" asked
Fudhayl. "The Prince of the Faithful," Fazl answered.
"What do you want?" was the reply;
"I have nothing to do with you, leave me alone and
don't waste my time." "But you should treat the
Caliph with honour, and let us in." "It is for you to
come in if you must, in spite of me," answered Fudhayl.
When the Caliph and his attendant entered, Fudhayl
extinguished the lamp in order not to see the intruders.
Harun-al-Rashid, having touched Fudhayl's hand in
the dark, the latter exclaimed, "How soft this hand is;
may it escape hell fire." Having thus spoken, he rose
to pray. As for the Caliph, he began to weep, and said,
"Speak to me at least one word." Fudhayl, when he
had finished his prayers, said to him, "O Harun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
thy ancestor Abbas, who was the paternal uncle of the
Prophet (on whom be peace!) said to him one day,
O Prophet of God, make me ruler over a nation.
The Prophet replied, I have made thee ruler over
thyself. If thou rulest thine own body and keepest it
constant in the service of the Lord, that is better than
ruling a nation for a thousand years. Again, Omar, the
son of Abd al Aziz, being installed on the throne of the
Caliphate, sent for three of his intimate friends, and said
to them, 'Behold me caught in the toils of the Caliphate;
how shall I get rid of them? Many people consider
power a blessing; I regard it as a calamity.'"</p>

<p>Then Fudhayl added, "O Harun, if thou wishest
to escape the punishment of the Day of Judgment,
regard each old man among the Moslems as thy father,
the young men as thy brothers, the women as thy
sisters. O Harun, I fear lest thy handsome visage
be scorched by the flames of hell. Fear the Most High,
and know that He will interrogate thee on the Day of
Resurrection." At these words, Harun-al-Rashid wept
copiously. Then Fazl said to Fudhayl, "Say no
more; you have killed the Caliph with grief." "Oh
Haman!"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Fudhayl answered, "it is not I, it is thou
and thy relations who have misled the Caliph and
destroyed him." Hearing these words, Harun-al-Rashid
wept still more bitterly, and said to Fazl,
"Be silent! If he has called you Haman, he has
(tacitly) compared me to Pharaoh." Then, addressing
Fudhayl, he asked him, "Have you any debt to pay?"
"Yes," he answered, "that of the service which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>owe to the Most High. He furnishes me with subsistence,
I have no need to borrow." Then Harun-al-Rashid
placed in Fudhayl's hand a purse in which were
a thousand pieces of gold, saying, "This money is
lawfully acquired, I have inherited it from my mother."
"Ah!" exclaimed Fudhayl, "my advice has been
wasted; my object in giving it was to lighten thy
burden; thou seekest to make mine more heavy."
At these words, Harun-al-Rashid rose, saluted him,
and departed. All the way home he kept repeating
to himself, "This Fudhayl is a great teacher." On
another occasion the Caliph is reported to have said
to Fudhayl, "How great is thy self-abnegation," to
which Fudhayl made answer, "Thine is greater."
"How so?" said the Caliph. "Because I make
abnegation of this world, and thou makest abnegation
of the next; now this world is transitory, and the
next will endure for ever."</p>

<p>Sofian Tsavri relates the following anecdote. "One
night I was talking with Fudhayl, and after we had
been conversing on all kinds of subjects, I said to him,
'What a pleasant evening we have had, and what
interesting conversation.' 'No,' he said, 'neither the
evening nor the conversation have been good.' 'Why
so?' I remarked. 'Because,' he said, 'you sought to
speak words which might please me, and I sought to
answer so as to gratify you. Both of us, pre-occupied
with our talk, had forgotten the Most High. It would
be better for each of us to sit still in his place and to
lift up his heart towards God.'"</p>

<p>A stranger coming to Fudhayl one day was asked
by the latter for what purpose he came. "I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
come," he answered, "to talk with you, and to find
in so doing calm of mind," "That is to say," broke in
Fudhayl, "you wish to mislead me with lies, and desire
me to do the same to you. Be off about your business."</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>But with all his austerity of life, his prolonged fasts
and watchings, his ragged dress and wearisome
pilgrimages, he preferred the practice of interior virtue
and purity of intention to all outward observances,
and used often to say that "he who is modest and compliant
to others and lives in meekness and patience
gains a higher reward by so doing than if he fasted all
his days and watched in prayer all his nights." At
so high a price did he place obedience to a spiritual
guide, and so necessary did he deem it, that he declared,
"Had I a promise of whatever I should ask in prayer,
yet would I not offer that prayer save in union with a
superior."</p>

<p>But his favourite virtue was the love of God in
perfect conformity to His will above all hope or fear.
Thus, when his only son (whose virtues resembled
his father's) died in early age, Fudhayl was seen with
a countenance of unusual cheerfulness, and, being
asked by his intimate disciple, Abou Ali, the reason
wherefore, he answered, "It was God's good pleasure,
and it is therefore my good pleasure also."</p>

<p>Others of his sayings are the following: "To leave
aught undone for the esteem of men is hypocrisy, and
to do ought for their esteem is idolatry." "Much is
he beguiled who serves God for fear or hope, for His
true service is for mere love." "I serve God because
I cannot help serving Him for very love's sake."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>BAYAZID BASTAMI<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 874 ad)</span></h4>


<p>Bayazid Bastami, whose grandfather was a Zoroastrian
converted to Islam, was distinguished for his
piety while still a child. His mother used to send
him regularly to the mosque to read the Koran with
a mullah. When he reached the chapter "Luqman,"
he read the verse, "Show thy gratitude in serving
Me, and show thy gratitude to thy parents in serving
them." He asked his teacher the meaning of the verse,
and had no sooner heard it explained than he immediately
ran home. When she saw him, his mother
said, "Why have you come home so early, my child?
Have they sent you for the fees?" "Mother,"
answered Bayezid, "I have just read the verse in
which the Lord commands me to serve Him, and to
serve thee; but, as I cannot serve in two places
at once, I have come to propose to you that you
should ask the Lord to give me to you in order
that I may serve you, or that you should yourself
give me to the Lord that I may serve Him." "Since
that is the case," said his mother, "I give you up to
the Lord, and renounce all my rights over you."
Accordingly, a few years afterwards, Bayazid left his
native village Bastam, and for thirty years lived as
a bare-footed ascetic in the deserts of Syria. Once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
during this time Bayazid came home and listened at
the door of his mother's house before going in. He
heard her saying in prayer, "May God bless my poor
exile, may the hearts of the pious be rejoiced by him
and accord him grace." Bayazid, hearing these words,
wept, and knocked at the door. "Who is there?"
she asked. "Thy exile," he answered. No sooner
had she opened the door than, embracing Bayazid,
she said to him, weeping, "O my son, separated from
thee as I have been, my eyes have lost the power to
see, and my back is bent," and they both mingled their
tears together.</p>

<p>Some time after Bayazid said to a friend, "What
I ought to have known most clearly is just what I have
only learnt when too late&mdash;to serve my mother. That
which I sought in devoting myself to so many religious
exercises, in putting myself at the service of others,
and in exiling myself far from my kindred and my
country, see, how I have discovered it. One night
when my mother asked for water, as there was none
in the pitcher, I went to the canal to draw some. It
was a winter night, and the frost was very sharp.
While I had gone for the water, my mother had fallen
asleep again. I stood waiting with the full pitcher in
my hand till she should awake. When she did so,
she asked for water, but when I wished to give it her,
I found that the water was frozen, and the handle
of the jug stuck fast to my hand. 'Why,' said my
mother, 'did you not put it down?' 'Because
I feared,' I answered, 'not to be ready when you
asked for it.' That same night the Lord revealed to
me all that I wanted to know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>Bayazid used to tell the following story. "A man
came to see me, and asked where I was going. 'I am
going to Mecca,' I said, 'to make the circuit of the
Kaaba.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> 'How much money hast thou?' he
asked. 'Two hundred pieces of gold,' I answered.
'Very well,' he said, 'give them me and walk seven
times round me. By this act of charity thou wilt
deserve a greater recompense than thou wouldest
obtain at the Kaaba.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> I did as he asked, and that
year I did not make the pilgrimage."</p>

<p>One day the thought crossed Bayazid's mind that
he was the greatest Sufi of the age. But no sooner had it
done so, than he understood it was an aberration on
his part. "I rose immediately," he said, "and went
some way into the desert of Khorassan, where I sat
down. I took then the resolution of not moving from
the spot where I was seated till the Lord should send
me someone who would make me see myself as I really
was. I waited thus for three days and three nights.
On the fourth night a rider on a camel approached.
I perceived on his countenance the marks of a penetrating
mind. He halted, and, fixing his eyes on me,
said, 'Thou desirest doubtless, that in the twinkling
of an eye I should cause to be swallowed up the village
of Bastam and all its population, together with its
riches, and Bayazid himself.' At these words I was
seized with an indescribable fear, and asked him,
'Whence comest thou?' 'O Bayazid,' he answered,
'while thou hast been seated here I have travelled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>three thousand miles. Take care, O Bayazid, to place
a curb on thy heart, and not to forget the road; else
shalt thou infallibly perish.' Then he turned his back
and departed."</p>

<p>One night Bayazid, having gone out of his house,
went to the burial-ground to perform his devotions.
There he found a young man playing a guitar, who
came towards him. Bayazid, considering music unlawful,
exclaimed, "There is no might or power except
in God."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The young man, irritated, struck the head
of Bayazid with his guitar, breaking it, and wounding
him. Bayazid returned home. The next morning very
early he placed some sweetmeats and some pieces of gold
in a dish and sent it to the young man, charging the
messenger to say from him, "Last night you broke your
guitar by striking my head with it; take, therefore, this
money, buy another guitar, and eat the sweetmeats so
that there may remain no rancour in your heart."
When he had received the message, the young man
came in tears to Bayazid, asked his pardon, and
repented.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Bayezid  was saying his prayers
in company with a friend. When they had finished their
devotions, his friend said to him, "Tell me, Bayazid,
you do not ask anything of anyone, you do not engage
in any industry; whence do you get your provision?"
"Wait a little," said Bayazid, "I am going to say
my prayers again." "Why?" "Because it is unlawful
to pray with a man who does not know Who is
the Bestower of daily bread."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>
<p>Hatim Assam used to say to his disciples, "If, on
the Day of Judgment you do not intercede for those
who will be conducted to hell, you are not my disciples."
Bayazid, having heard this, said in his turn,
"Those only are my disciples who, on the Day of
Judgment, will stand on the brink of hell, in order to
seize and save the wretches cast down thither, even
were it necessary to enter hell themselves for the
salvation of the others."</p>

<p>Bayazid related as follows. "One day I heard a
Voice, which said, 'O Bayazid, our treasure-house is
brimmed full with acts of adoration and devotion
offered by men; bring Us something which is not in
Our treasury.' 'But, O God,' I cried, 'what then
shall I bring?' And the voice answered me, 'Bring
Me sorrow of heart, humility, contrition.'"</p>

<p>Another time he said, "After having endured the
rigours of asceticism for forty years, one night I found
myself before the doors and curtains which hide the
throne of God. 'For pity's sake,' I exclaimed,
groaning, 'let me pass.' 'O Bayazid,' cried a Voice,
'you still possess a pitcher and an old cloak; you
cannot pass.' Then I cast away the pitcher and the
cloak, and I heard the Voice again address me, 'O
Bayazid, go and say to those who do not know:
"Behold, for forty years I have practised rigorous
asceticism. Well, till I cast away my broken pitcher
and torn cloak, I could not find access to God; and
you, who are entangled in the ties of worldly interests,
how shall you discover the way to Him?"'"</p>

<p>One night, after having said his evening prayer,
Bayazid remained standing till the morning, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
shedding tears. When morning came, his servant
asked him, "What has happened to you to-night?"
"Methought I had arrived at the throne of God,"
replied Bayazid, and I said to it, 'O Throne, we are
taught that the Lord rests on thee.' 'O Bayazid,'
replied the throne, 'it is said here that the Lord dwells
in a humble heart; but where is the intelligence
capable of penetrating this mystery? Heavenly beings
question earthly ones concerning it, and they only
cast the question back.'</p>

<p>Bayazid said once, "When I had arrived at the
station of Proximity, I heard a Voice say to me, 'O
Bayazid, ask what thou hast to ask.' 'My God,'
I answered, 'Thou art the Object of my desire.' 'O
Bayazid,' the Voice replied, 'if there lingers in thee
an atom of earthly desire, and till thou art reduced to
nothing in the station of Annihilation, thou canst not
find Me.' 'My God,' I answered, 'I shall not return
from Thy Court empty-handed; I wish to ask something
from Thee.' 'Very well, ask it.' 'Grant me
mercy for all men.' The Voice said, 'O Bayazid
lift up thine eyes.' I lifted them, and I saw that the
Most High was far more inclined to have mercy on
His servants than I. 'Lord,' I cried, 'have mercy
on Satan.' 'O Bayazid,' the Voice answered, 'Satan
is made of fire, and fire must needs go to the fire.
Take heed lest thou thyself deserve to go there.'"</p>

<p>One day, when Bayazid was walking along the road,
a young man who followed him closely, setting his
feet in his tracks, said to him, "Tear off a piece of thy
cloak and give it me, in order that thy blessing may
rest upon me." Bayazid answered, "Although thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
strip Bayazid of his skin and clothe thyself with it,
it will profit thee nothing, unless thou reproduce the
actions of Bayazid."</p>

<p>Amongst other remarkable utterances of Bayazid
are the following. "When from hatred to the world
I fled to the Lord, His love so filled my heart that I
hated myself." "He who relies on his acts of piety
is worse than he who commits sin." "There are those
among the servants of the Lord who would utter groans
like the damned in hell if one put them in possession
of the eight paradises without Him." "A single
grain of the love of Cod is worth more than a hundred
thousand paradises." "He whom the Lord loves is
known by three distinct signs&mdash;his liberality is like
the sea, his kindness is like the sun, his humility is
like the earth, which allows itself to be trampled on by
everyone." "Whoso has the knowledge of the Lord
receives from Him intuitional wisdom in such a manner
that he needs not to have recourse to anyone to learn
anything."</p>

<p>Being asked his age, he replied, "I am four years
old." "How is that, Sheikh?" they said. "For
seventy years," he said, "I have been enveloped in the
veils of this dull world; it is only four years since I
disentangled myself from them and see God." Being
asked to define Sufism, he said, "Sufism consists in
giving up repose, and accepting suffering."</p>

<p>In the last moments of his life he put on a girdle
and seated himself in the "mihrab"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> of the mosque.
Then, turning his cloak and cap inside out, he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>"My God, I ask for no reward for the austerities I have
practised all my life. I say nothing of the prayers
which I have prayed during whole nights, of the fasts
I have kept during the day, of the number of times
I have said the Koran through. O my God, thou
knowest that I think nothing of the works which I
have done, and that so far from putting trust in them,
I would rather forget them. Besides, is it not thou
who hast covered my nakedness with the raiment of
these good works? As for me, I consider myself as a
fire-worshipper who has grown to old age in a state of
infidelity. But now I say 'Allah! Allah!' and I
cut the girdle of the idolator. I enter Islam as a new
proselyte, and I repeat the profession of the Moslem
faith. I reckon all that I have done nothing. Deign,
for Thy mercy's sake, to blot out all my evil deeds
and transgressions." When he was dying, he again
ejaculated "Allah! Allah!" Then he cried, "My
God, I have passed my life in neglect of thee; I have
not served Thee faithfully," and expired.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>ZU'N NUN OF EGYPT<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 860 ad)</span></h4>


<p>Ibn Khalliqan, the historian, calls Zu'n Nun "the
first person of his age for learning, devotion and communion
with the Divinity." His father, who was a
native of Nubia, was a slave, enfranchised and adopted
by the tribe of Koraish. Zu'n Nun, being asked why
he had renounced the world, said, "I went forth from
Misr (Egypt) journeying to a certain village, and I fell
asleep in one of the deserts on the way. And my eye
was opened, and lo, a little bird, still blind, fell from
its nest to the ground. Then the ground split open
and two trays came forth, one of gold, the other of
silver; in one was sesame, and in the other water;
and the bird ate of that, and drank of this. 'That',
said I, 'is a sufficient warning for me; I renounce the
world.' And then I did not quit the door of divine
mercy till I was let in."</p>

<p>Having been denounced by his enemies to the Caliph
Mutawakkil of Bagdad, he was summoned from Egypt
to appear before him. On entering into his presence,
he addressed a pious exhortation to the Caliph, who
shed tears, and dismissed him honourably. After
this, whenever men of piety were spoken of before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Caliph, he would weep and say, "Speaking of pious
men, let me have Zu'n Nun."</p>

<p>At Cairo, however, Z'un Nun did not come off so easily.
He openly rebuked the vices of the inhabitants, and
especially of the local governors, who caused him to be
beaten and imprisoned. "All this is as nothing, so I
be not separated from thee, O my God," was his exclamation
while dragged through the crowded street
with blows and insults by the soldiers of the garrison.</p>

<p>Zu'n Nun related the following story of himself.
"One day I saw a beautiful palace on the bank of a
river where I was performing my devotions. On the
roof of this palace I perceived a lovely maiden. Curious
of learning who she was, I approached and asked her
the name of her master. She answered, 'O Zu'n Nun
when you were still a great way off, I took you for a
madman, when you came nearer, for a religious man,
when you came still nearer, for one of the initiated.
I now perceive that you are neither mad, nor religious,
nor initiated. If you had been mad, you would not
have engaged in religious exercises; if you had been
religious, you would not have looked at a person whom
you ought not to approach; if you had been initiated,
nothing would have drawn your attention away from
God.' So saying, she disappeared. I then recognised
that she was no mortal, but an angel."</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>Zu'n Nun relates that he heard his spiritual teacher
Schakran recount the following story. "When I was
young, I lived on the eastern bank of the Nile, near
Cairo, and gained my livelihood by ferrying passengers
across to the western side. One day, as I was sitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>in my boat near the river edge, an aged man presented
himself before me; he wore a tattered robe, a staff was
in his hand, and a water-skin suspended from his neck.
'Will you ferry me over for the love of God?' said he.
I answered, 'Yes.' 'And will you fulfil my commission
for the love of God?' 'Yes.' Accordingly, I rowed
him across to the western side. On alighting from the
boat, he pointed to a solitary tree some distance off,
and said to me, 'Now go your way, and do not trouble
yourself further about me till to-morrow; nor indeed
will it be in your power, even should you desire it,
for as soon as I have left you, you will at once forget me.
But to-morrow, at this same hour of noon, you will
suddenly call me to mind. Then go to that tree which
you see before you, I shall be lying dead in its shade.
Say the customary prayers over my corpse, and bury
me; then take my robe, my staff and the water-skin,
and return with them to the other side of the river;
there deliver them to him who shall first ask them of
you. This is my commission.'</p>

<p>"Having said this, he immediately departed. I
looked after him, but soon lost sight of him; and then,
as he had himself already forewarned me, I utterly
forgot him. But next day, at the approach of noon,
I suddenly remembered the event, and hastily crossing
the river alone, I came to the western bank, and then
made straight for the tree. In its shade I found him
stretched out at full length, with a calm and smiling
face, but dead. I recited over him the customary
prayers, and buried him in the sand at the foot of the
tree; then I took the garment, the staff and the water-skin,
and returned to my boat. Arrived at the eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
side, I found standing on the shore to meet me a young
man whom I knew as a most dissolute fellow of the
town, a hired musician by profession. He was gaudily
dressed, his countenance bore the traces of recent
debauch, and his fingers were stained with henna.
'Give me the bequest,' said he. Amazed at such a
demand from such a character, 'What bequest?'
I answered. 'The staff, the water-skin and the
garment,' was his reply. Thereupon I drew them,
though unwillingly, from the bottom of the boat,
where I had concealed them, and gave them to him.
He at once stripped off his gay clothes, put on the
tattered robe, hung the water-skin round his neck,
took the staff in his hand, and turned to depart.</p>

<p>"I, however, caught hold of him and exclaimed,
'For God's sake, ere you go, tell me the meaning of this,
and how this bequest has become yours, such as I
know you.' 'By no merit of my own, certainly,'
answered he; 'but I passed last night at a wedding-feast,
with many boon companions, in singing, drinking
deep, and mad debauch. As the night wore away and
morning drew near, tired out with pleasure and heavy
with wine, I lay down to sleep. Then in my sleep
one stood by me, and said, "God has at this very
hour taken to himself the soul of such an ascetic, and
has chosen you to fill his place on earth. Rise and
go to the river bank, there you will meet a ferryman
in his boat; demand from him the bequest. He
will give you a garment, a staff and a water-skin; take
them, and live as their first owner lived."'</p>

<p>"Such was his story. He then bade me farewell,
and went his way. But I wept bitterly over my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
loss, in that I had not been chosen in his place as
successor to the dead saint, and thought that such a
favour would have been more worthily bestowed on
me than on him. But that same night, as I slept,
I heard a voice saying unto me, 'Schakran, is it grief
to thee that I have called an erring servant of Mine
to repentance? The favour is My free gift, and I
bestow such on whom I will, nor yet do I forget those
who seek Me.' I awoke from sleep, and repented of
my impatient ambition."</p>

<p>Zu'n Nun had a disciple who had made the pilgrimage
to the Kaaba forty times, and during forty years had
passed all his nights in devotional exercises. One
day he came to Zu'n Nun and said, "During the forty
years that I have practised austerity, nothing of the
unseen world has been revealed to me; the Friend
(<i>i.e</i>., God) has not spoken to me, nor cast upon me a
single look. I fear lest I die and leave this world in
despair. Thou, who are the physician of sick souls,
devise some means for my cure." "Go," Zu'n Nun
replied, "this evening, omit your prayers, eat as much
as you like, and go to sleep. Doubtless, if the Friend
does not look upon you with an eye of mercy, He will
at any rate look upon you with an eye of anger." The
dervish went away, but said his prayers as usual, saying
to himself that it would be wrong to omit them. Then
he ate to satiety, and went to sleep. In his dreams
he saw the Prophet, who said to him, "O Dervish,
the Friend sends thee his salutation, and says, 'Surely
that man is pusillanimous who, as soon as he has arrived
at My court, hastens to return; set thy feet on this
path like a brave man, and then We will give thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the reward for all the austerities which thou hast
practised for forty years, and make thee reach the
goal of thy desires.'"</p>

<p>Perhaps someone may ask why Zu'n Nun told his
disciple to omit his prayers. We should consider that
sheikhs are physicians knowing the remedy for every
kind of disease. Now there are many diseases whose
treatment involves the use of poisons. Besides, Zu'n
Nun knew well that his disciple would certainly not
neglect his prayers. There are in the spiritual path
(<i>tariqat</i>) many things not justifiable according to the
written law (<i>shariat</i>). It is thus that the Lord ordered
Abraham to slay his son, an act unlawful according
to the written law. But whoever, without having attained
to so high a degree in the spiritual life as Zu'n
Nun, should act as he did in this matter would be a
being without faith or law; for each one in his actions
must conform to the decisions of the written law.</p>

<p>Zu'n Nun related once the following. "When I
was making the circuit of the Kaaba, I saw a man with
a pale face and emaciated frame. I said to him, 'Dost
thou really love Him?' 'Yes,' he answered. 'Does
the Friend come near thee?' 'Yes, assuredly.' 'Is
He kind to thee?' 'Yes, certainly.' 'What!' I
exclaimed, 'the Friend approaches thee, He is kind
to thee, and look at the wretched state of thy body!'
He replied, 'Simpleton! Knowest thou not that they
whom the Friend approaches most nearly, are the most
severely tried?'"</p>

<p>"One day," said Zu'n Nun, "when I was travelling,
I arrived at a plain covered with snow. I saw a fire-worshipper
who was strewing seeds of millet there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
'O infidel,' I said, 'why are you strewing this millet?'
'To-day,' he said, 'as it has been snowing, I reflected
that the birds would find nothing to eat, and I strewed
this millet that they may find some food, and I hope
that the Most High will perchance have mercy upon
me.' 'The grain which an infidel sows,' I replied,
'does not germinate, and thou art a fire-worshipper.'
'Well,' he answered, 'even if God does not accept
my offering, may I not hope that He sees what I am
doing?' 'Certainly He sees it,' I said. 'If He sees
it,' he remarked 'that is enough for me.'</p>

<p>"Long afterwards I met this infidel at Mecca
making the circuit of the Kaaba. He recognised me,
and exclaimed, 'O Zu'n Nun, the Most High, witnessing
my act, has accepted it. The grain I sowed has indeed
sprung up, for God has given me faith, and brought
me to His House.' "Seeing him," added Zu'n Nun,
"I rejoiced, and cried, 'My God, dost Thou give paradise
to an infidel for a handful of millet seed?' Then I
heard a voice reply, 'O Zu'n Nun, the mercy of the
Lord is without limit.'"</p>

<p>Zu'n Nun daily asked three things of God in prayer.
The first was never to have any certainty of his means
of subsistence for the morrow. The second was never
to be in honour among men. And the third was to
see God's face in mercy at his death-hour. Near the
end of his life, one of his more intimate disciples
ventured to question him on this triple prayer, and
what had been its result. "As for the first and second
petitions," answered Zu'n Nun, "God has liberally
granted them, and I trust in His goodness that He will
not refuse me the third."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>During his last moments he was asked what he wished.
"I wish," he replied, "that if I have only one more
breath left, it may be spent in blessing the Most High."
As he said this, he breathed his last.</p>

<p>He died <span class="smcap">860 a.d</span>., and his tomb is still an object of
popular veneration at Cairo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>MANSUR HALLAJ<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 922 ad)</span></h4>


<p>Mansur Hallaj ("the cotton-comber"), a Persian,
of Zoroastrian lineage, was a pupil of Junaid of Bagdad,
a more sober-minded Sufi than his contemporary
Bayazid Bastami. Mansur himself however was of an
enthusiastic temperament, and took no pains to guard
his language. One of his extraordinary utterances, "I
am the truth," led at last to his execution, "the
Truth" being one of the recognised names of God in
Muhammadan nomenclature. Notwithstanding this,
even at the present day he passes among the Sufis for
one of their greatest saints, while the more orthodox
regard him as a daring blasphemer who received his
deserts. "His contemporaries," says a Muhammadan
writer, "entertained as many different views concerning
him as the Jews and Christians with respect to
the Messiah." Certainly when we read the various
accounts of him by authors of different tendencies,
if we did not know to the contrary, we might suppose
ourselves reading about different persons bearing the
same name. The orthodox regard him chiefly as a
sorcerer in league with supernatural powers, whether
celestial or infernal, for he caused, it is said, summer
fruits to appear in winter and <i>vice versa</i>. He could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
reveal in open day what had been done in secret, knew
everyone's most private thoughts, and when he extended
his empty hand in the air he drew it back full
of coins bearing the inscription, "Say: God is One."
Among the moderate Shiites, who had more than one
point of contact with the Sufis, it is not a question
of sorcery at all. For them the doctrine of Hallaj,
which he had also practised himself, meant that by
using abstinence, by refusing pleasure and by chastising
the flesh, man can lift himself gradually to the height
of the elect and even of angels. If he perseveres in
this path he is gradually purged from everything human,
he receives the spirit of God as Jesus did, and all that
he does is done by God.</p>

<p>The Shiites say, moreover, that the reason for which
Hallaj was put to death should be found not in his
utterances but in the astonishing influence which
he exercised over the highest classes of society, on
princes and their courts, and which caused much disquietude
to others, especially to the orthodox mullahs.
Hallaj has even been judged not unfavourably by
those among the orthodox who were characterised by
a certain breadth of view, and who, like Ghazzali,
although they disliked free-thinking, yet wished for
a religion of the heart, and were not content with the
dry orthodoxy of the great majority of theologians.
Ghazzali indeed has gone so far as to put a favourable
construction on the following sayings of Hallaj: "I
am the Truth," "There is nothing in Paradise except
God." He justifies them on the ground of the speaker's
excessive love for God. In his eyes, as well as in
those of other great authorities, Hallaj is a saint and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
a martyr. The most learned theologians of the tenth
century, on the contrary, believed that he deserved
execution as an infidel and a blasphemer. Even the
greatest admirers of Hallaj, the Sufis, are not agreed
regarding him. Some of them question whether he
were a thorough-going pantheist, and think that he
taught a numerical Pantheism, an immanence of the
Deity in certain souls only. But this is not the
opinion of the majority of the Sufis. The high esteem
which they entertain for him is best understood by
comparing the account they give of his martyrdom
with that by orthodox writers. The latter runs as
follows:</p>

<p>The common people of Bagdad were circulating
reports that Hallaj could raise the dead, and that the
Jinn<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> were his slaves, and brought him whatever he
desired. Hamid, the vizier of the Caliph Muqtadir,
was much disturbed by this, and requested the Caliph
to have Hallaj and his partizans arrested. But the
grand chamberlain Nasir was strongly in his favour, and
opposed this; his influence, however, being less than
that of the vizier, Hallaj and some of his followers
were arrested. When the latter were questioned,
they admitted that they regarded their leader as God,
since he raised the dead; but when he was questioned
himself, he said, "God preserve me from claiming
divinity or the dignity of a prophet; I am a mortal man
who adores the Most High."</p>

<p>The vizier then summoned two cadis<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and the
principal theologians, and desired that they should
give sentence against Hallaj. They answered that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>they could not pronounce sentence without proofs
and without confession on the part of the accused.
The vizier, foiled in his attempt, caused Hallaj to be
brought several times before him, and tried by artfully
devised questions to elicit from him some heretical
utterance, but in vain. Finally he succeeded in finding
in one of his books the assertion that if a man wished
to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, but was hindered
from doing so by some reason or other, he could perform
the equivalent of it in the following way. He should
go through all the prescribed circuits in a chamber
carefully cleansed and closed. In this chamber also
he should give a feast of the choicest food to thirty
orphans, should wait upon them himself, make them
a present of clothing, and give them each seven dirhems.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
All this, he maintained, would be a work more meritorious
than the pilgrimage itself.</p>

<p>The vizier showed to the cadi Abou Amr this passage
which scandalised him. Abou Amr then asked Hallaj,
"Whence did you derive this idea?" Hallaj quoted
a work of Hassan of Basra, from which he said he had
taken it. "It is a lie, O infidel, whose death is lawful,"
exclaimed the cadi; "the book you speak of was expounded
to us at Mecca by one of the learned, but what
you have written is not in it." The vizier eagerly
caught up the expressions "O infidel," etc., which escaped
the cadi in his excitement, and asked him to
pronounce sentence of death. The cadi refused; that,
he said, was not his intention; but the vizier insisted,
and ended by obtaining the sentence of death, which
was signed by all the maulvies present. In vain Hallaj
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>sought to prove that the condemnation was unjust.
"You have no right," he exclaimed, "to shed my blood.
My religion is Islam; I believe in the traditions handed
down from the Prophet, and I have written on this
subject books which you can find everywhere. I have
always acknowledged the four Imams<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and the first
four Caliphs. I invoke the help of God to save my
life!"</p>

<p>He was taken to prison. The vizier despatched
the sentence of death, signed by the maulvies, to the
Caliph, who ordered that Hallaj should be handed to
the Chief of Police and receive a thousand strokes of
the rod, and then another thousand if he did not die
from the effects of the first scourging, and finally be
decapitated. The vizier, however, did not transmit
the order accurately, but modified it as follows: "If
Hallaj does not die under the blows of the rod, let
him first have a hand cut off, then a foot, then the other
hand and foot. Lastly let his head be cut off, and his
body burnt."</p>

<p>Hallaj underwent the terrible punishment with
admirable courage, and when his body had been burnt
the ashes were cast into the Tigris. But his disciples
did not believe in his death; they were persuaded that
a person resembling him had been martyred in his
place, and that he would show himself again after
forty days. Some declared that they had met him
mounted on an ass on the road leading to Nahrawan,
and had heard him say, "Be not like those simpletons
who think that I have been scourged and put to
death."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>
<p>Thus far the theologians' account. That given by
Fariduddin Attar in his "Tazkirat-ul-Aulia" is as
follows:</p>

<p>This is he who was a martyr in the way of truth,
whose rank has become exalted, whose outer and inner
man were pure, who has been a pattern of loyalty
in love, whom an irresistible longing drew towards
the contemplation of the face of God; this is the
enthusiast Mansur Hallaj, may the mercy of God be
upon him! He was intoxicated with a love whose
flames consumed him. The miracles he worked were
such that the learned were thunderstruck at them.
He was a man whose range of vision was immense,
whose words were riddles, and profoundly versed in
the knowledge of mysteries. Born in the canton of
Baida in the province of Shiraz, he grew up at Wasit.</p>

<p>Abd Allah Khafif used to say, "Mansur really
possessed the knowledge of the truth." "I and
Mansur," declared Shibli,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> "followed the same path;
they regarded me as mad, and my life was saved
thereby, while Mansur perished because he was sane."
If Mansur had been really astray in error, the two
learned men we have just quoted would not have spoken
of him in such terms. Many wise men, however,
have reproached him for revealing the mysteries of
truth to the vulgar herd.</p>

<p>When he had grown up, he was two years in the
service of Abd Allah Teshtari. He made the pilgrimage
to Mecca, and on his return became a disciple of the
Sufi Junaid. One day, when Mansur was plying him
with questions on certain obscure and difficult points,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>Junaid said, "O Mansur, before very long you will
redden the head of the stake."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> "The day when I
redden the head of the stake," rejoined Mansur, "you
will cast away the garment of the dervish and assume
that of ordinary men." It is related that on the day
when Mansur was taken to execution all the Ulama<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
signed the sentence of death. "Junaid also must
sign," said the Caliph. Junaid accordingly repaired
to the college of the Ulama, where, after putting on
a mullah's robe and turban, he recorded in writing his
opinion that "though apparently Mansur deserved
death, inwardly he possessed the knowledge of the
Most High."</p>

<p>Having left Bagdad, Mansur spent a year at Tashter,
then he spent five years in travelling through Khorassan,
Seistan and Turkestan. On his return to Bagdad,
the number of his followers largely increased, and he
gave utterance to many strange sayings which excited
the suspicions of the orthodox. At last he began
to say, "I am the Truth." These words were repeated
to the Caliph, and many persons renounced Mansur
as a religious leader and appeared as witnesses against
him. Among these was Junaid, to whom the Caliph
said, "O Junaid, what is the meaning of this saying of
Mansur?" "O Caliph," answered Junaid, "this man
should be put to death, for such a saying cannot be
reasonably explained." The Caliph then ordered him
to be cast into prison. There for a whole year he
continued to hold discussions with the learned. At
the end of that time the Caliph forbade that anyone
should have access to him; in consequence, no one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>went to see him for five months except Abd Allah
Khafif. Another time Ibn Ata sent someone to say to
him, "O Sheikh, withdraw what you said, so that you
may escape death." "Nay, rather he who sent you
to me should ask forgiveness," replied Mansur. Ibn
Ata, hearing this, shed tears and said, "Alas, he is
irreparably lost!"</p>

<p>In order to force him to retract, he was first of all
given three hundred blows with a rod, but in vain.
He was then led to execution. A crowd of about a
hundred thousand men followed him, and as he looked
round on them, he cried, "True! True! True! I am
the Truth!"</p>

<p>It is said that among them was a dervish who asked
him, "What is love?" "Thou shalt see," Mansur
replied, "to-day and to-morrow and the day after."
And, as it happened, that day he was put to death, the
next day his body was burnt, and on the third his
ashes were scattered to the winds. He meant that
such would be the results of his love to God. On his
son asking of him a last piece of advice, "While the
people of the world," he said, "spend their energies
on earthly objects, do thou apply thyself to a study, the
least portion of which is worth all that men and Jinn
can produce&mdash;the study of truth."</p>

<p>As he walked along lightly and alertly, though
loaded with many chains, they asked him the reason
of his confident bearing. "It is," he said, "because
I am going to the presence of the King." Then he
added, "My Host, in whom there is no injustice, has
presented me with the drink which is usually given to
a guest; but when the cups have began to circulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he has sent for the executioner with his sword and
leathern carpet. Thus fares it with him who drinks
with the Dragon<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> in July."</p>

<p>When he reached the scaffold, he turned his face
towards the western gate of Bagdad, and set his foot
on the first rung of the ladder, "the first step heaven-*ward,"
as he said. Then he girded himself with a
girdle, and, lifting up his hands towards heaven, turned
towards Mecca, and said exultantly, "Let it be as He
has willed." When he reached the platform of the
scaffold, a group of his disciples called out to him,
"What do you say regarding us, thy disciples, and
regarding those who deny thy claims and are about to
stone thee?" "They will have a two-fold reward,
and you only a single one," he answered, "for you limit
yourselves to having a good opinion of me, while they
are carried on by their zeal for the unity of God and
for the written law. Now in the law the doctrine of
God's unity is fundamental, while a good opinion is
merely accessory."</p>

<p>Shibli the Sufi stood in front of him and cried, "Did
we not tell thee not to gather men together?"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Then
he added, "O Hallaj, what is Sufism?" "Thou
seest," replied Hallaj, "the least part of it." "What
is then the highest?" asked Shibli. "Thou canst not
attain to it," he answered.</p>

<p>Then they all began to stone him. Shibli making
common cause with the others threw mud at him.
Hallaj uttered a cry. "What," said one, "you have
not flinched under this hail of stones, and now you cry
out because of a little mud! Why is that?" "Ah!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>he replied, "they do not know what they are doing,
and are excusable; but he grieves me because he knows
I ought not to be stoned at all."</p>

<p>When they cut off his hands, he laughed and said,
"To cut off the hands of a fettered man is easy, but
to sever the links which bind me to the Divinity would
be a task indeed." Then they cut off his two feet.
He said smiling, "With these I used to accomplish my
earthly journeys, but I have another pair of feet with
which I can traverse both worlds. Hew these off if
ye can!" Then, with his bleeding stumps, he rubbed
his cheeks and arms. "Why do you do that?" he
was asked. "I have lost much blood," he answered,
"and lest you should think the pallor of my countenance
betokens fear, I have reddened my cheeks." "But
why your arms." "The ablutions of love must be
made in blood," he replied.</p>

<p>Then his eyes were torn out. At this a tumult
arose in the crowd. Some burst into tears, others
cast stones at him. When they were about to cut out
his tongue, he exclaimed, "Wait a little; I have something
to say." Then, lifting his face towards heaven,
he said, "My God, for the sake of these sufferings,
which they inflict on me because of Thee, do not inflict
loss upon them nor deprive them of their share of
felicity. Behold, upon the scaffold of my torture I
enjoy the contemplation of Thy glory." His last
words were, "Help me, O Thou only One, to whom
there is no second!" and he recited the following
verse of the Koran, "Those who do not believe say,
'Why does not the day of judgment hasten?' Those
who believe tremble at the mention of it, for they know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
that it is near." Then they cut out his tongue, and he
smiled. Finally, at the time of evening prayer, his
head was cut off. His body was burnt, and the ashes
thrown into the Tigris.</p>

<p>The high opinion entertained of Mansur Hallaj by
Fariduddin Attar, as seen in the above account, has
been echoed by subsequent Sufi writers. Jalaluddin
Rumi, the great mystic poet, says of him:</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pharaoh said 'I am the Truth,'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and was laid low.</span>
<span class="i1">Mansur Hallaj said 'I am the Truth,' and escaped free.</span>
<span class="i0">Pharaoh's 'I' was followed by the curse of God.</span>
<span class="i1">Mansur's 'I' was followed by the mercies of God.</span>
<span class="i0">Because Pharaoh was a stone, Mansur a ruby,</span>
<span class="i1">Pharaoh an enemy of light, Mansur a friend.</span>
<span class="i0">Mansur's 'I am He,' was a deep mystic saying,</span>
<span class="i1">Expressing union with the light, not mere incarnation."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Similarly Abdurrahman, the chief poet of the Afghans
says:</p>

<div class="poem2">

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>HABIB AJAMI<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 773 ad)</span></h4>


<p>Habib Ajami was a rich usurer of Basra, and used
to spend most of his time going about and collecting
the money which was due to him. He used also to
insist on being paid for the time so spent. One day
he had gone to the house of one of his debtors, and
when he had knocked at the door the debtor's wife
said to him, "My husband is not at home." "If he is
not," said Habib, "pay me for my lost time and I will
go." "But I have nothing," replied the woman,
"except a neck of mutton." She fetched it and gave
it to him. Habib took it home to his wife, and told
her to cook it. "But," said she, "we have no bread
or wood." So Habib went off again, exacted his
indemnity for lost time from another debtor, and
bought wood and bread, which he took home. His
wife set about cooking the food, when a dervish appeared
at the door asking alms. "Go away," said
Habib to him; "you won't become rich with what
you get here." The dervish departed in silence.
Habib's wife prepared to put the food on the plates,
but when she looked into the cooking pot she saw a
mass of blood. Filled with terror, she said to Habib,
"Your harshness towards the dervish has brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
this misfortune on us. All the food in the cooking pot
has turned to blood." Habib, frightened himself,
repented, and, as a pledge of the reality of his conversion,
vowed to abandon the practice of usury. The following
day was a Friday. Habib, having gone out, saw as
he was walking along, children playing on the road.
They no sooner saw him than they said to each other,
"Here is the usurer coming; let us be off, lest the
dust raised by his feet touch us and we become cursed
like him." At these words Habib Ajami was profoundly
stirred, and went off to consult Hasan Basri,
whom he found in the act of preaching on the terrors
of the judgment-day. Habib was so overcome with
fear that he fainted. When he came to himself, he
made public confession of his sins in the presence of
Hasan Basri and the congregation.</p>

<p>Then he left the mosque and returned home. One of
his debtors, seeing him on the road, attempted to get
out of his way, but Habib called after him and said,
"Don't fly away; formerly you used to avoid me,
but now it is I who seek to avoid you." As he approached
his house he met the same children as before,
and heard them say to one another, "We must get
out of the way, lest the dust raised by our feet should
soil Habib, who has repented." Habib, hearing this,
exclaimed, "O Lord, in that very hour, when, returning
from my errors, I have taken refuge with Thee, Thou
hast put affection for me in the hearts of Thy friends,
and changed into blessings the curses which used to
greet my name."</p>

<p>He remitted all the debts that were due to him, and
gave public notice that all his debtors had only to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
come and take back their bonds. They all came and
did so. Then he gave away all the wealth he had been
amassing for years, till he had nothing left. He built
a hermitage on the banks of the Euphrates, where he
gave himself up to a devotional life, spending whole
nights in prayer. During the day he attended the
instructions of Hasan Basri. At the commencement
of his religious life he received the appellation "Ajami"
(ill-instructed) because he could not pronounce the
words of the Koran properly.</p>

<p>After some time his wife began to complain, saying,
"I must really have some money; we have neither food
to eat nor clothes to wear." At this time Habib was
in the habit of going every day to his hermitage on the
banks of the river, and spending the day in devotional
exercises. In the evenings he came home. One evening
his wife asked him where he had been during the day.
"I have been working," he replied. "Very well,
where are your wages?" she asked. "My employer,"
said Habib, "is a generous person. He has promised
to pay me at the end of ten days." So he continued
spending his time as before. On the tenth day, as
he reflected in his hermitage, he wondered what he
should say to his wife when he returned in the evening,
and she wanted something to eat. That day four
men came to the house of Habib. One brought a
quantity of flour, another a sheep, a third a jar of
honey, and the fourth a bottle of oil. Not long after
them a fifth came with a purse of gold. They gave all
these to Habib's wife, saying to her, "Your husband's
Employer has sent these," and they added, "Tell
your husband that his Master bids him continue his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
work, and He will continue his wages." Then they
departed.</p>

<p>In the evening Habib came home, pensive and
anxious. As he entered the house an odour of cooking
greeted him. His wife hastened to meet him, and said,
"O Habib, go on working for your employer, for he
is very generous, and has sent all that you see here,
with this message that you are to go on working, and
he will continue to pay you." Hearing this, Habib
became more confirmed than ever in his resolve to give
up the world and to live to God.</p>

<p>One day Hasan Basri paid Habib a visit in his
hermitage. The latter had two barley loaves and a
little salt, which he placed before his guest. Just
as the latter was commencing to eat and in the act
of stretching out his hand, a dervish appeared at the
door and asked for alms. Habib immediately handed
him the two loaves. Hasan, somewhat ruffled, said,
"Habib, you are a good man, but you would be none
the worse for a little culture and intelligence. Don't
you know that one ought never to take food away
from before a guest? At any rate, you might have
given one of those loaves to the dervish, and left the
other." Habib made no reply. Some minutes afterwards
a man came carrying in a napkin a roast lamb,
a large plate of sweetmeats, and some money. He
set them before Habib and said, "Sir, so and so sends
you these with his compliments." Habib and Hasan
made a hearty meal, and Habib distributed the money
to some passing mendicants. Then he said to Hasan
Basri, "My master, you are a good man, but it would
have been better had you shown more sincerity in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
this matter, for then you would have possessed
both knowledge and sincerity, and the two go well
together."</p>

<p>On another occasion Hasan Basri arrived at Habib's
hermitage just as the latter was commencing his
evening prayers. Hearing him pronounce the words
"al hamdu<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>" as "al hemdu," Hasan said to himself,
"This man cannot pronounce the words of the Koran
properly; it is impossible to pray with him," and he
said his prayers apart. That same night he saw the
Lord in a dream, and asked him, "Lord, what must
I do to gain Thy approval." An answer came, "O
Hasan, thou hadst gained it, but didst not appreciate
its value. Thou shouldest have prayed with Habib
Ajami. Such a prayer would have had more worth
than all those which thou hast made in the course of
thy life. The tongues of others may speak rightly, but
the heart of Habib feels rightly."</p>

<p>One day Hasan Basri, flying from the agents of
Hejjaj ibn Yusuf, the bloodthirsty governor of Irak,
took refuge in Habib's hermitage. The pursuers,
arriving, asked Habib whether Hasan had passed
that way. "No," he said, "he is here in my dwelling."
They entered, and seeing no one said to Habib, "O
Habib, whatever treatment Hejjaj deals out to you,
you will have richly deserved it. Why did you lie to
us?" "I tell you," said Habib, "Hasan is within
this dwelling; if you don't see him, what can I do?"
They again made a search, but not succeeding in finding
Hasan, departed. Hasan then came out of his hiding-place,
and said, "O Habib, is this the way thou re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>payest thy debt to thy master, by betraying him?"
"Master," answered Habib, "it is thanks to my truthfulness
that thou hast escaped. If I had told a lie
we should have both been caught." Hasan then said,
"What words didst thou recite as a safeguard?" "I
repeated ten times," said Habib, "the 'Verse of the
throne,'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> ten times 'Believe in the Apostle,'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> six times
'Say, there is one God,' and in addition I said, 'Lord,
I entrust Hasan to Thee; take care of him.'"</p>

<p>Hasan then asked Habib how he had arrived at
such a high degree of sanctity. "I spend my time,"
he said, "in purifying my heart, while you spend
yours in blackening paper" (Hasan having written
many theological works). "Alas!" said Hasan.
"Must then my knowledge benefit others, only while
I have nothing but the outward show of it?"</p>

<p>"We must not suppose," says Fariduddin Attar in
narrating the above incident, "that Habib had really
attained a higher degree of piety than Hasan; for
in the eyes of the Lord nothing is higher than knowledge.
The doctors of Islam have said truly, 'In the
spiritual path the gift of performing miracles is the
fourteenth stage, while knowledge is the eighteenth.
The gift of miracles is the reward of many works of
piety, while the knowledge of mysteries is revealed
only to profound meditation. Consider the case of
Solomon, upon whom be peace! He understood the
language of birds, and yet, though arrived at such
a high degree of knowledge, he submitted to the
Law given by Moses, and acted according to its
instructions.'"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>
<p>Every time that he heard the Koran read, Habib
used to weep bitterly. Some one said to him, "You
are a barbarian (the literal meaning of the word 'Ajami').
The Koran is in Arabic, and you don't understand it;
why then do you weep?" "It is true," he said
"my tongue is barbarian, but my heart is Arab."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4>AVICENNA (IBN SINA)<br />
<span class="smcap">(ad 980-1037)</span></h4>


<p>Avicenna, now best known as a philosopher, was
perhaps better known in the middle ages as a kind of
magician owing to the mastery of medical science. His
father was a native of Balkh, but removed from that
city to Bokhara; having displayed great abilities
as a government tax collector he was appointed to
fill that office in a town called Kharmaithen, one of the
dependencies of Bokhara. Here Avicenna was born.
At the age of ten years he was a perfect master of the
Koran, and had studied arithmetic and algebra.</p>

<p>The philosopher An-Natili having visited them about
that time, Avicenna's father lodged him in his own
house, and Avicenna studied under him logic, Euclid
and the Almagest (an astronomical treatise of Ptolemy).
He soon surpassed his master, and explained to him
difficulties and obscurities which the latter had not
understood. On the departure of An-Natili, Avicenna
applied himself to the study of natural philosophy,
divinity, and other sciences. He then felt an inclination
to learn medicine, and studied medical works;
he treated patients, not for gain, but in order to increase
his knowledge. When he was sixteen years of age,
physicians of the highest eminence came to him for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
instruction and to learn from him those modes of
treatment which he had discovered by his practice.
But the greater portion of his time was given to the
study of logic and philosophy. "When I was perplexed
about any question," he says in an autobiographical
fragment, "I went to the mosque and prayed
God to resolve the difficulty. At night I returned home;
I lit the lamp, and set myself to read and write. When
I felt myself growing tired and sleepy I drank a glass
of wine, which renewed my energy, and then resumed
reading. When finally I fell asleep I kept dreaming
of the problems which had exercised my waking thoughts,
and as a matter of fact often discovered the solution
of them in my sleep."</p>

<p>When he came across the "Metaphysics" of Aristotle,
that work in spite of his acuteness seemed to present
an insuperable difficulty. "I read this book," he says,
"but I did not understand it, and the purport of it
remained so obscure to me that though I read it forty
times through and could repeat it by heart, I was as
far from understanding it as ever. In despair, I said
to myself, 'This book is quite incomprehensible.'
One day at the time of afternoon prayer I went to a
bookseller's, and there I met a friend who had a book
in his hand, which he praised and showed me. I looked
at it in a listless way and handed it back, certain that it
was of no use to me. But he said to me, 'Buy it;
it is very cheap. I will sell it you for three dirhems;
its owner is in need of money.' It was a commentary of
Al Farabi on the metaphysics of Aristotle. I bought it,
took it home and began to read it. Immediately all
my difficulties were cleared up, as I knew the "Meta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>physics"
by heart. I was delighted, and the next
day distributed alms to the poor in order to show my
gratitude to God."</p>

<p>About this time the Emir Nuh Ibn Mansur, prince
of Khorassan, fell ill, and having heard of Avicenna's
talent, sent for him and was restored to health under
his treatment. As a reward, Avicenna was allowed
to study in the prince's library, which contained several
chests of rare manuscripts. Here he discovered treatises
on the sciences of the ancients, and other subjects, the
essence of which he extracted. It happened some time
afterwards that this library was destroyed by fire,
and Avicenna remained the sole depository of the knowledge
which it contained. Some persons even said
that it was he who had set fire to the library because
he alone was acquainted with its contents, and wished
to be their sole possessor.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he had completely mastered
all the sciences which he had studied. The death of
his father and the fall of the Samanide dynasty forced
him to quit those literary treasures which he had learnt
to appreciate so well. At the age of twenty-two he
left Bokhara and went to Jorjan, the capital of Khwarezm
where he frequented the Court of Shah Ali ibn Mamoun.
At this time the celebrated Sultan Mahmoud of Ghazni,
having heard that there were several learned men,
and among them Avicenna, at the Court of Mamoun,
requested the latter to send them to him. Several
of them went, but Avicenna refused, probably because
his orthodoxy was suspected, and Sultan Mahmoud
was a strict Sunni. Mahmoud was much displeased
at not seeing Avicenna appear at his court with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
rest, and sent descriptions and drawings of him in
several directions in order that he might be arrested.
In the meantime, Avicenna finding the allowance made
to him at the Court of Mamoun insufficient, left Jorjan
and wandered through the towns of Khorassan. Finally
he settled in a little village near Balkh. There he composed
the greater part of his philosophical works,
and among others the book on the "Eternal Principle
and the Return of the Soul." Some time afterwards
he was called to Hamadan to treat the Buwayhid
Sultan Shams-ed Dawla, who suffered from a dangerous
gastric malady. He was successful in curing the Sultan,
who showed his gratitude by appointing Avicenna his
vizier.</p>

<p>The affairs of State did not prevent Avicenna from
carrying on his studies, for during his stay at Hamadan
he found time to commence his exposition of the
philosophy of Aristotle entitled the "Shifa" which he
undertook at the Sultan's request. At this time
Avicenna presented the rare spectacle of a philosopher
discharging the functions of a statesman, without injury
to either statesmanship or philosophy. His
great physical energy enabled him to spend the day in
the service of the Sultan and a great part of the night
in philosophical discussions with his disciples. His
writings, which date from this time, allow us to
judge with what success he pursued his philosophical
studies, and we have every reason to believe that he
was equally successful in the conduct of affairs, for,
after the death of Shams-ed-Dawla, his son and successor
Taj-ed-Dawla requested him to retain the post
of vizier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>Avicenna appreciated this testimony to his worth,
but declined the offer in order to devote himself to
the completion of his great work, the Shifa. But even
in his studious retirement he was not out of reach of
political disturbance. Suspected of carrying on secret
correspondence with Ala-ed-Dawla, the governor of
Ispahan, an enemy of Taj-ed-Dawla, Avicenna was
imprisoned in a neighbouring fortress. He would
probably have remained there a long time had not the
fortune of war put Ala-ed-Dawla in possession of
Hamadan, Avicenna was liberated after an imprisonment
of four months. Despite this misadventure he
succeeded during his stay at Hamadan in completing
the Shifa and several medical treatises, besides, a little
mystical allegory, "Hay ibn Yokdhan" ("The living
one, son of the Waking One"). This shows the
mystical side of Avicenna's philosophy, and we therefore
subjoin an abridgment and explanation of it.</p>

<p>"During my sojourn in a certain country, I used to
make excursions with my friends to pleasant spots
in our vicinity. One day when strolling out with them
I met an old man who, in spite of his advanced age,
seemed brimful of juvenile ardour, being neither bent
nor having white hairs. We felt attracted by him and
accosted him. After the usual salutations, I opened
the conversation by requesting him to inform us about
himself, his trade, name, family, and country. 'As
to my name and family,' he answered, 'I am called
Hay ibn Yokdhan, and I was born in Jerusalem;
as to my occupation, it consists in traversing all the
regions of the earth, always following the direction
indicated by my Father. He has entrusted to me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
keys of all the sciences and guided me through all ways
even to the utmost bounds of the universe.' We
continued to ask him questions regarding different
branches of science till we touched on the science of
physiognomy, on which he spoke with marvellous
precision, taking it as the starting point of a discourse
which he delivered to us."</p>

<p>This exordium may be interpreted as follows:
"During the sojourn of my soul in the body I felt a
desire under the guidance of my imagination and my
senses to examine whatever presented itself to me.
While thus engaged, I came in contact with active
Intelligence (the old man), the salutary effects of which
I had long experienced and which had preserved my
vigour unabated. I commenced to examine the nature
of this Intelligence freed as it is from all material
grossness and yet in a certain way, linked to the material
world. Since life includes the two conditions necessary
to actual development, consciousness and movement,
he calls himself 'Hay' 'the Living,' and adds 'ibn
Yokdhan' 'Son of the Waking,' meaning that he
derives his origin from a Being higher than himself,
Who is always awake and has no need of repose. His
birthplace is the holy city of Jerusalem, free from
all earthly stain, and his occupation is to traverse the
highest regions open to intelligence in order to understand
the nature of his heavenly Father, who has
committed to him the keys of all forms of knowledge.
Thus, favoured by his help, we arrive at Logic, a
science which leads by sure and evident conclusions
to a knowledge of what is remote and occult.
For this reason logic is indicated by the term 'physi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>ognomy'
which judges of the hidden by its outward
manifestation."</p>

<p>After this commencement the allegory proceeds:
"Logic," continued the old man, "is a science whose
income is paid in ready money; she brings to light
what nature conceals, and what may be a source of
either joy or sorrow; she points you out the way of
freedom from earthly entanglements and sensual
propensities. If her healing hand touches you, it
will give you salutary support, but if your weakness
cause you to stumble, you will be exposed to ruin,
accompanied as you always are by bad companions<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
from which it is impossible to get free.</p>

<p>"As to thy nearest companion (imagination), he is
a confused babbler, abounding in futility and falsity;
he brings you news in which truth and falsehood are
mingled together, and that, though he professes to
be your guide and enlightener. He often brings matters
before you very ill-suited to your dignity and position,
and you must be at the pains of distinguishing the false
from the true in them. But for all that, he is very
necessary to you, and would exert a healthy influence
on you, if his false witness did not lead you into error.</p>

<p>"But your companion on the right (irascibility) is
still more impetuous, and it is only with the greatest
difficulty that his attacks can be repulsed by reason
or avoided by dexterity. He is like a blazing fire,
a rushing torrent, a runaway horse, or a lioness deprived
of its young. Similarly with your left-hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>companion (carnal concupiscence) whose evil influence
springs from insatiable appetite; he is like a famished
beast let loose to graze. Such are your companions,
unhappy mortal, to whom you are tied, and from
whom no release is to be obtained except by migrating
to those countries where such creatures are unknown.
But till you are allowed to do so, your hand at any rate
must tame them; beware of flinging the rein on their
necks and giving them free course; if you hold the
reins tight they will submit, and you will be master."</p>

<p>"After I had heard this description of my companions,
I began to recognise the justice of it, and accordingly
I varied gentleness and severity in my treatment of
them. Alternately I and they had the upper hand.
But I constantly invoked the help of God in this respect,
until I was delivered. Meanwhile I prepared for
the journey, and the old man added this last counsel:
'You and those like you will be constantly impeded
in this journey, and the road will be very difficult for
you, unless you can succeed in quitting this world
for ever; but you cannot hasten the time fixed by
God. You must therefore be content with a frequently
interrupted progress; sometimes you will make way,
sometimes you will be at the beck and call of your
companions. When you apply yourself with your
whole heart to making progress, you will succeed, and
your companions will lose all influence over you; but
if you connive at their importunities, they will conquer
you, and you will altogether lose touch with me.'</p>

<p>"I then asked the old man for information on the
various regions of the universe, of which he possessed
ample knowledge, and he replied: 'The universe has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
three parts; first, the visible heaven and earth, the
nature of which is ascertainable by ordinary observation:
But as to the other two parts, they are marvellous
indeed; one is on the East, the other on the West.
Each of these regions is separated from our world by
a barrier which only a few elect souls succeed in passing,
and that only by divine grace; the man who relies only
on his natural powers is excluded from them. What
makes the passage thither easier is to wash in the flowing
waters of the fountain whose source is close to a stagnant
pool.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The traveller who has found the way to it
and is refreshed by its healing waters, will feel himself
endued with a marvellous energy, which will help him
to traverse savage deserts. Unfatigued he will scale
the heights of Mount Kaf, and the guardians of hell will
lose all power to seize him and to cast him into
the abyss.'</p>

<p>"We asked him to explain more precisely the situation
of this fountain, and he said: 'You are doubtless aware
that perpetual darkness surrounds the pole<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> unpenetrated
by any ray of light till God permits. But he who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>fearlessly enters this darkness will emerge into a clearly
lighted plain, where he will find this springing fountain.</p>

<p>"We then asked him to tell us more about the
Western region bordering our earth, of which he had
spoken, and he gave us the following information:</p>

<p>"'In the extreme West is an immense sea called
in the Divine Revelation<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> "the miry sea," where the
sun sets and along which stretches a desolate and
sterile land, where the inhabitants never abide but
are always passing away, and which is covered by
thick darkness. Those who go there are exposed to
every kind of illusion. The sun only gives a feeble
light, the soil is completely barren, whatever is built
there is soon destroyed again, conflict and strife perpetually
rage there, whatever gets the upper hand
tyrannises over those which were in power before it.
There are found all kinds of animals and plants passing
through strange developments.</p>

<p>"'Now if you turn to the East<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> you will see a region
where there is no human being, nor plant, nor tree,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>nor animal; it is an immense and empty plain. Crossing
it, you will reach a mountainous region, where are
clouds and strong winds and rapid rivers; there are
also gold and silver and precious stones, but no plants.
From thence you will pass into a region where there are
plants but no animals, then into another where there
are animals but no men. Lastly you will arrive at a
region where there are human beings such as are familiar
to you.</p>

<p>"'After passing the extreme limit of the East, you
will see the sun rising between the two horns of Satan,
"the flying horn" and "the marching horn." This
latter is divided into two parts, one having the form
of a fierce animal, the other of a gross one; between
these two composing the left horn is perpetual strife.
As to "the flying horn," it has no one distinct form,
but is composed of several, such as a winged man,
a serpent with a swine's head, or merely a foot or an
arm. The human soul which rules this region has
established five ways of communication under the
care of a watchman who takes whatever comes along
them and passes it on to a treasurer who presents it
to the King.</p>

<p>"'The two horns continually attack the human
soul, even to the point of driving it to madness. As
to "the marching horn," the fierce animal of which it
is partly composed lays a trap for man by embellishing
in his eyes all his evil actions, murder, mutilation,
oppression and destruction, by exciting his hatred and
impelling him to violence and injustice; while the
other part in the shape of a gross animal continually
attacks the human soul by casting a glamour over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
vileness and foulness and urging her thereto; nor does
it cease its assaults till she is brought into complete
subjection. It is seconded in its attacks by the spirits
of the flying horn, which make man reject whatever
he cannot see with his own eyes, whispering to him that
there is no resurrection nor retribution nor spiritual
Lord of the universe.</p>

<p>"'Passing hence, we find a region inhabited by
beings of angelic origin, free from the defects abovementioned.
They enter into communication with man,
and contribute towards his spiritual progress. These
are the intellectual faculties, which, though they are
far below the pure Intelligences, have an instinctive
desire to shake off the yoke of irascibility and concupiscence.
Beyond this region is that of the angels,
and further still, one directly governed by the Great
King, and dwelt in by his faithful servants, who are
engaged in fulfilling His commands. These are free
from all evil inclination, whether to concupiscence or
injustice or envy or idleness. To them is committed
the defence of the frontier of this Kingdom, which they
guard in person. Allotted to different parts, they
occupy lofty forts constructed of crystal and precious
stones, which surpass in durability all that may be
found in the region of earth. They are immortal, and
subject to no feebleness nor decay of force in discharging
their duties.</p>

<p>"'Beyond this region again are beings in immediate
and continual relation with the supreme King, constantly
occupied in His service, and never replaced by others.
They are allowed to approach the Lord, to contemplate
the throne of His Majesty and to adore Him, enjoying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the sight of Him continually and without intermission.
They have the gentlest natures, great spiritual beauty,
and a keen faculty of penetration and of arriving at
the truth. To each has been assigned a distinct place
and fixed rank, which can be shared by no one. Highest
of all is that unique being, the nearest to the Lord,
and the parent of all the rest. Active Intelligence<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>; it
is by his mediation that the word and commandment of
the Lord go forth to all the other beings of creation.</p>

<p>"'In this highest region all are pure spirits, having no
relation to matter, except in so far as innate desire
may set them in movement or cause them to move
others. From such desire only, the Lord himself is
absolutely exempt.</p>

<p>"'Those who think that He had a beginning are
in complete error, and those who think to describe Him
fully are beside themselves. In relation to Him all
description and comparison are impossible. Those
who attempt to describe Him can only indicate the
distance which separates Him from all human attributes;
the beauty of being is represented in scriptural language
by His Face and His infinite bounty by His Hand.
If even one of the cherubims wished to contemplate
His essence, he would be dazzled and frustrated by
His glory. Since beauty is the veil of beauty, His
manifestation must always remain a mystery, in the
same way as the sun, when lightly obscured by a cloud
allows its disc to be seen, but when it blazes forth in
all its splendour, its disc is veiled from human eye by
excess of light. The Lord, however, is always communicating
His splendour to His creation without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>grudging or reserve; He imparts Himself generously
and the plenitude of His bounty is without limit:
He who has the least glimpse of His beauty remains
entranced by it for ever; sometimes saints of extraordinary
attainments who have given themselves
up to Him and have been favoured by His grace,
aware of the worthlessness of the perishable world,
when, from their ecstatic state they return to it, are
haunted for the rest of their lives by regret and
sadness.'</p>

<p>"Here Hay ibn Yokdhan closed his discourse by
adding:</p>

<p>"'If I had not, in thus addressing you, been acting
in obedience to the commands of my Lord, I would
rather have left you for Him. If you will, accompany
me on the path of safety.'"</p>

<p>Thus concludes this brief allegory, which, like
Avicenna's other mystical treatises, is concerned with
the progress and development of the human soul.
According to him, the soul is created for eternity, and
the object of its union with the body is the formation
of a spiritual and independent microcosm. During our
earthly life we have but a dim presentiment of this
future condition; this presentiment produces in different
characters a lesser or greater desire for it, and the
thoroughness of our preparation depends on this desire.
This preparation is only accomplished by the development
of the highest faculties of the soul, and the inferior
faculties of the senses furnish the indispensable
basis for this.</p>

<p>Every human faculty has some pleasure corresponding
to it. The pleasure of the appetitive faculty for ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>ample,
is to receive a sensation which accords with its
desire; the pleasure of the irascible faculty is attack;
the pleasure of the surmising faculty, hope; that of
the recollective faculty, memory. Generally speaking,
the pleasures attending these faculties consist in their
realising themselves in action, but they differ widely
in rank, the soul's delight in intellectual perception of
realities, in which the knower and the known are one,
being incomparably higher than any mere sensual
satisfaction. By attaining to such perceptions, the
soul prepares itself for the beatitude of the next life.
The degree of this beatitude will correspond to the
intensity of spiritual desire awakened in it during its
earthly sojourn.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>It is extremely difficult, not to say impossible, to
determine the degrees of beatitude of the soul after
death. We may, nevertheless, understand that the
various impediments of passions, prejudices, etc., to
which its union with the body has given rise, are not
immediately dissolved on its separation from the body.
Souls thus hindered may pass into a state depicted by
Plato and other ancient philosophers, in which they
are still weighed down by the passions they indulged in.
Every soul is eternal and imperishable, and will finally
attain the beatitude for which it was created. But
it may be punished after death by a shorter or longer
exclusion from that beatitude. To suppose with
Alexander Aphrodisius that an imperfect or ill-prepared
soul may be annihilated, would be to admit a belief
at complete variance with its eternal essence and origin.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>
<p>But we may well conjecture that the punishment of
such ill-prepared and refractory souls would consist
in their being in a state in which after separation from
the body they still pine after sensual enjoyments and
suffer from the impossibility of such gratification.</p>

<p>It may also be supposed that such ill-prepared souls
remember the notions that were current in this world
regarding beatitude and damnation; their conceptions
would in that case resemble dreams which are often
more vivid than impressions received in waking moments.
They would imagine themselves undergoing the examination
in the tomb and all the other punishments
depicted in the Koran, or it may be enjoying the sensual
pleasures there described. On the other hand, the
noble and well-prepared soul will pass at once to the
contemplation of the eternal, and will be exempt
from every memory and every conception relating to
this world. For if anything of this kind remained in
it as a reminder of its union with the body, it would
so far fall short of the plenitude of its perfection.</p>

<p>Besides his mystical treatise "On the soul," Avicenna
has left a short but remarkable poem on the same subject,
which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">"THE SOUL.</span></h4>

<p>"It descended upon thee from the lofty station
(heaven); a dove rare and uncaptured, curtained from
the eyes of every knower yet which is manifest and never
wore a veil.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It came to thee unwillingly and it may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>perhaps be unwilling to abandon thee although it complain
of its sufferings. It resisted at first, and would
not become familiar, but when it was in friendly union
with the body, it grew accustomed to the desert waste
(the world). Methinks it then forgot the recollections
of the protected park (heaven), and of those abodes
which it left with regret; but when in its spiral descent
it arrived at the centre of its circle in the terrestrial
world, it was united to the infirmity of the material
body and remained among the monuments and prostrate
ruins. It now remembers the protected park and
weepeth with tears which flow and cease not till the
time for setting out towards the protected park approacheth;
till the instant of departure for the vast
plain (the spiritual world) draweth nigh. It then
cooeth on the top of a lofty pinnacle (for knowledge
can exalt all who were not exalted) and it has come
to the knowledge of every mystery in the universe,
while yet its tattered vest hath not been mended.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>"Its descent was predestined so that it might hear
what it had not heard, else why did it descend from
the high and lofty heaven to the depth of the low and
humble earth? If God sent it down by a decision of
His will, His motive is concealed from the intelligence
of man. Why did it descend to be withheld from the
exalted summit of heaven by the coarse net of the body,
and to be detained in a cage? It is like a flash of
lightning shining over the meadow, and disappearing
as if it had never gleamed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>
<p>Although Avicenna's reputation in the Muhammedan
world has always been high, his mystical treatises have
generally been regarded as heretical, and many have
only been preserved in Hebrew translations. He
himself says explicitly that he only intended them for
his most intimate disciples, and forbade them to be
communicated to the multitude. For his own part,
he conformed to the religious law and customs. The
celebrated contemporary Sufi Abou Said Abi'l Khair
having asked his opinion regarding the custom of
praying for the dead, and visiting their tombs, he
answers thus:</p>

<p>"God the Unique Being and Source of all that
exists&mdash;angels, intelligences exempt from connection
with matter, souls united to matter, elements in all their
varied developments&mdash;animal, vegetable and mineral,
inspires His whole creation, and His omniscience
embraces all. His influence in the first place acts
immediately on the Active Intelligences and angels,
who in their turn act on souls which in their turn act
on our sublunary world. If there were not homogeneity
of substance between celestial and terrestrial
souls and likeness between the macrocosm of the
universe, and the microcosm of man, the knowledge
of God would be impossible for us, as the Prophet
himself hath said, 'He who knows himself, knows God.'
All creation, whose parts are linked together, is subject
to influences which all derive from a single source&mdash;God.
Terrestrial souls differ widely in rank; the highest are
endowed with gifts of prophecy, and perfected so far
that they attain the sphere of pure intelligence. A soul
of this kind entering after death into eternal beatitude,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
shared with its peers, continues along with them to
exercise a certain influence on terrestrial souls. The
object of prayer for the dead and visiting their tombs
is to beg for the help of those pure souls, a help which
is realised sometimes in a material, sometimes in a
spiritual way. The former kind of help may be compared
with the direction which the body receives from
the brain; spiritual assistance is realised by the purification
of the mind from every thought but that of God."</p>

<p>Avicenna, after his liberation from imprisonment by
Ala-ed-Dowla, being anxious to quit Hamadan, left
the city secretly with his brother, his disciple Joujani and
two servants, all five disguised as Sufis. After a
painful journey they reached Ispahan, where they were
received in a friendly manner by Ala-ed-Dowla. Avicenna
here continued to hold philosophical discussions
as he had done at Hamadan. At Ispahan he also
composed two of his most important works, the "Shifa"
and the "Najat," treating of medicine. Later on he
followed Ala-ed-Dowla to Bagdad, but on the way
was seized with a gastric malady, accompanied by an
attack of apoplexy. He recovered at the time, but
not long afterwards the sickness returned, and he died
at the age of 57, <span class="smcap">a.d. 1037.</span></p>

<p>In his Literary History of Persia (vo. II., p. 108)
Professor Browne points out that one of the most
celebrated stanzas in Fitzgerald's translation of Omar
Khayyam was really composed by Avicenna:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Up from earth's centre through the Seventh Gate</span>
<span class="i0">I rose, and on the throne of Saturn sate,</span>
<span class="i0">And many a knot unravelled by the road,</span>

</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Another interesting link between the two philosophers
is supplied by the fact, mentioned by Professor Browne,
that a few days before his death Omar Khayyam was
reading in the "Shifa" of Avicenna the chapter treating
of the One and of the Many.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">35</span></a> The bad companions of man which hinder his intellectual

of philosophy will grasp the scheme of the universe without

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4>AL GHAZZALI<br />

<span class="smcap">(ad 1058&mdash;1111)</span></h4>


<p>Al Ghazzali is one of the deepest thinkers, greatest
theologians and profoundest moralists of Islam. In
all Muhammadan lands he is celebrated both as an
apologist of orthodoxy and a warm advocate of Sufi
mysticism. Intimately acquainted with all the learning
of his time, he was not only one of the numerous oriental
philosophers who traverse every sphere of intellectual
activity, but one of those rarer minds whose originality
is not crushed by their learning. He was imbued
with a sacred enthusiasm for the triumph of his faith,
and his whole life was dedicated to one purpose&mdash;the
defence of Islam. As Browning says, "he made life
consist of one idea." His full name was Abu Hamid
Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ahmed Algazzali,
and he was born at Tus in Khorassan, <span class="smcap">1058 a.d</span>., where
a generation earlier Firdausi, the author of the Shah-*nama,
had died. Tus was already famous for learning
and culture, and later on Ghazzali's own fame caused
the town to become a centre of pilgrimage for pious
Moslems, till it was laid in ruins by Genghis Khan,
a century after Ghazzali's death.</p>

<p>His birth occurred at a time when the power of the
Caliphs had been long on the wane, and the Turkish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
militia, like the Pretorian guards of the later Roman
empire, were the real dispensers of power. While the
political unity of Islam had been broken up into a
number of mutually-opposed states, Islam itself was
threatened by dangers from without. In Spain,
Alphonso II. had begun to press the Moors hardly.
Before Ghazzali was forty, Peter the Hermit was preaching
the First Crusade, and during his lifetime Baldwin
of Bouillon was proclaimed King in the Mosque of
Omar at Jerusalem. But more serious than these outer
foes was the great schism which had split Islam into
the two great opposing parties of Shiahs and Sunnis&mdash;a
schism which was embittered and complicated by the
struggle of rival dynasties for power. While the Shiites
prevailed in Egypt and Persia, the Turks and Seljuks
were Sunnis. In Bagdad the seat of the Caliphate
during the reign of Al Kasim, when Ghazzali was a
youth, fatal encounters between the two contending
factions were of daily occurrence. Ghazzali's native
city was Shiite, and not till Khorassan had been conquered
by the Ghaznevides and Seljuks did Sunni
teaching prevail there. Yet, however bitterly Shiahs
and Sunnis might be opposed to each other, they both
counted as orthodox and were agreed as to the fundamental
principles of Islam, nor did their strife endanger
the religion itself. But besides the two great parties
of Shiahs and Sunnis, a mass of heretical sects, classed
under the common name of Mutazilites, had sprung
up within Islam. These heretics had studied Aristotle
and Greek philosophy in Arabic translations, and for a
long time all that the orthodox could do was to thunder
anathemas at them and denounce all speculation. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
at last Al Asha'ari, himself formerly a Mutazilite,
renounced his heresies, and sought to defend orthodoxy
and confute the heretics on philosophical grounds.</p>

<p>The Mutazilites had cultivated the study of philosophy
with especial zeal, and therefore the struggle with them
was a fierce one, complicated as it was by political
animosity. The most dangerous sect of all was that
of the Ismailians and Assassins, with their doctrine of
a hidden Imam or leader. In some of his works Ghazzali
gives special attention to confuting these.</p>

<p>The whole aspect and condition of Islam during
Ghazzali's lifetime was such as to cause a devout Moslem
deep distress and anxiety. It is therefore natural that
a man who, after long and earnest search, had found
rest and peace in Islam, should have bent all the energies
of his enthusiastic character to oppose these destructive
forces to the utmost. Ghazzali is never weary of
exhorting those who have no faith to study the Muhammadan
revelation; he defends religion in a philosophical
way against the philosophers, refutes the heretics, chides
the laxity of the Shiites, defends the austere principles
of the Schafiites, champions orthodoxy, and finally,
by word and example, urges his readers towards the
mysticism and asceticism of the Sufis. His numerous
writings are all directed to one or another of these objects.
As a recognition of his endeavours, the Muhammadan
Church has conferred upon him the title of "Hujjat
al Islam," "the witness of Islam."</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of notice that when the power of the
Caliphs was shattered and Muhammadanism, already
in a state of decline, precisely at that period theology
and all other sciences were flourishing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>The reason of this may be found in the fact that nearly
all the Muhammadan dynasties, however much they
might be opposed to each other, zealously favoured
literature and science. Besides this, the more earnest
spirits, weary of the political confusions of the time,
devoted themselves all the more fervently to cultivating
the inner life, in which they sought compensation
and refuge from outward distractions. Ghazzali was
the most striking figure among all these. Of his early
history not much is known. His father is said to have
died while he was a child, but he had a brother Abu'l
Futuh Ahmed Alghazzali, who was in great favour
with the Sultan Malik Shah, and owing to his zeal for
Islam had won the title of "Glory of the Faith." From
the similarity of their pursuits we gather that the relationship
between the brothers must have been a close
one. Ibn Khalliqan the historian informs us that later
on Abu'l Futuh succeeded his brother as professor,
and abridged his most important literary work, "The
Revival of the religious sciences." While still a youth,
Ghazzali studied theology at Jorjan under the Imam
Abu Nasr Ismail. On his return journey from Jorjan
to Tus, he is said to have fallen into the hands of robbers.
They took from him all that he had, but at his earnest
entreaty returned to him his note books, at the same
time telling him that he could know nothing really, if
he could be so easily deprived of his knowledge. This
made him resolve for the future to learn everything by
heart.</p>

<p>Later on Ghazzali studied at Nishapur under the
celebrated Abu'l-Maali. Here also at the court of the
Vizier Nizam-ul-mulk (the school-fellow of Omar Khay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>yam)
he took a distinguished part in those discussions
on poetry and philosophy which were so popular in the
East. In 1091 Nizam-ul-mulk appointed him to the
professorship of Jurisprudence in the Nizamiya College
at Bagdad, which he had founded twenty-four years
previously. Here Ghazzali lectured to a class of 300
students. In his leisure hours, as he informs us in
his brief autobiography, "Al munkidh min uddallal"
("The Deliverance from error") he busied himself
with the study of philosophy. He also received a
commission from the Caliph to refute the doctrine of
the Ismailians.</p>

<p>In the first chapter it has been mentioned how
a deep-seated unrest and thirst for peace led him, after
many mental struggles, to throw up his appointment
and betake himself to religious seclusion at Damascus
and Jerusalem. This, together with his pilgrimage to
Mecca and Medina, lasted nearly ten years. Ibn
Khalliqan informs us that he also went to Egypt and
stayed some time in Alexandria. Here the fame of the
Almoravide leader in Spain, Yusuf ibn Tashifin, is said
to have reached Ghazzali, and to have made him think
of journeying thither. This prince had begun those
campaigns in Spain against the Cid and other Christian
leaders which were destined to add Andalusia to his
Moroccan dominions. By these victories in the West
he had to some extent retrieved the decline of Islam in
the East. It is natural to suppose that the enthusiastic
Ghazzali would gladly have met with this champion of
Muhammadanism. The news of Yusuf ibn Tashifin's
death in 1106 seems to have made him renounce his
intention of proceeding to Spain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>The realisation of Ghazzali's wish to withdraw from
public affairs and give himself to a contemplative life
was now interrupted. The requests of his children
and other family affairs, of which we have no exact
information, caused him to return home. Besides
this, the continued progress of the Ismailians, the spread
of irreligious doctrines, and the increasing religious
indifference of the masses not only filled Ghazzali and
his Sufi friends with profound grief but determined them
to stem the evil with the whole force of their philosophy,
the ardour of vital conviction, and the authority of
noble example.</p>

<p>In addition, the governor of Nishapur, Muhammad
Ibn Malikshah, had asked Ghazzali to proceed thither in
order to help to bring about a religious revival. Thus,
after an absence of ten years, he returned to Nishapur
to resume his post as teacher. But his activity at this
period was directed to a different aim than that of the
former one. Regarding the contrast he speaks like
a Muhammadan Thomas &aacute; Kempis. Formerly, he says,
he taught a knowledge which won him fame and glory,
but now he taught a knowledge which brought just the
opposite. Inspired with an earnest desire for the
spiritual progress of his co-religionists and himself,
and convinced that he was called to this task by God,
he prays the Almighty to lead and enlighten him, so that
he may do the same for others.</p>

<p>How long Ghazzali occupied his professorship at
Nishapur the second time is not precisely clear. Only
five or six years of his life remained, and towards the
close he again resigned his post to give himself up to a
life of contemplation to which he felt irresistibly drawn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
in his native city of Tus. Here he spent the rest of
days in devotional exercises in friendly intercourses
with other Sufis and in religious instruction of the young.
He died, devout as he lived, in the fifty-fourth year of
his age, <span class="smcap">a.d. 1111</span>. He founded a convent for Sufis
and a professorship of jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Ghazzali's activity as an author during his relatively
short life was enormous. According to the literary
historians, he is the author of ninety-nine different
works. These are not all known to us, but there are
existing in the West a considerable quantity of them,
some in Latin and Hebrew translations, as he was
much studied by the Jews in the Middle Ages. A
writer in the Jewish Encyclop&aelig;dia says (<i>sub. voc.</i>),
"From his 'Makasid-al-Falasifah' in which he expounded
logic, physics and metaphysics according to
Aristotle, many a Jewish student of philosophy derived
much accurate information. It was not, however,
through his attacks on philosophy that Ghazzali's
authority was established among Jewish thinkers of
the middle ages, but through the ethical teachings in
his theological works. He approached the ethical
idea of Judaism to such an extent that some supposed
him to be actually drifting in that direction."</p>

<p>Although Ghazzali was a Persian, both by race and
birthplace, most of his works are composed in Arabic,
that language being as familiar to Muhammadan
theologians as Latin to those of Europe in the Middle
Ages. One of his most important works is the "Tahafut
al falasifah," "Destruction of the Philosophers,"
which the great Averroes endeavoured to refute. Somewhat
in the style of Mr. Balfour's "Defence of philo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>sophic
doubt," Ghazzali attempts to erect his religious
system on a basis of scepticism. He denies causation
as thoroughly as Hume, but asserts that the divine
mind has ordained that certain phenomena shall always
occur in a certain order, and that philosophy without
faith is powerless to discover God. Although chiefly
famous in the West as a philosopher, he himself would
probably have repudiated the title. He tells us that
his object in studying philosophy was to confute the
philosophers. His true element was not philosophy
but religion, with which his whole being was penetrated,
and which met all his spiritual needs. Even in his most
heterogeneous studies he always kept before him one aim&mdash;the
confirmation, spread, and glorification of Islam.</p>

<p>It is true that more than one of his contemporaries
accused him of hypocrisy, saying that he had an esoteric
doctrine for himself and his private circle of friends,
and an exoteric for the vulgar. His Sufistic leanings
might lend some colour to this accusation, it being a
well-known Sufi habit to cloak their teaching under
a metaphorical veil, wine representing the love of God,
etc., as in Hafiz and Omar Khayyam. Against this
must be set the fact that in his autobiography written
near the close of his life, he constantly refers to his
former works, which he would hardly have done had
he been conscious of any striking discrepancy between
his earlier and his later teaching. There is no reason to
doubt his previously-quoted statement that he "studied
philosophy in order to refute the philosophers."</p>

<p>He was, at any rate, intensely indignant at having
his orthodoxy impugned, as appears from a striking
story narrated by the Arabic historian Abu'l Feda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
He tells us that Ghazzali's most important work, "The
revival of the religious sciences" had created a great
sensation when it reached Cordova. The Muhammadan
theologians of Spain were rigidly orthodox, and accused
the work of being tainted by heresy. They represented
to the Caliph Ali Ibn Yusuf that not only this but all
Ghazzali's other works which circulated in Andalusia
should be collected and burnt, which was accordingly
done. Not long after, a young Berber from North
Africa named Ibn Tumart wandered to Bagdad, where
he attended Ghazzali's lectures. Ghazzali noticing
the foreigner, accosted him, and inquired regarding
religious affairs in the West, and how his works had
been received there. To his horror he learned that
they had been condemned as heretical and committed
to the flames by order of the Almoravide Caliph Ali.
Upon this, Ghazzali, raising his hands towards heaven,
exclaimed in a voice shaken with emotion, "O God,
destroy his kingdom as he has destroyed my books,
and take all power from him." Ibn Tumart, in sympathy
with his teacher, said, "O Imam<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Ghazzali, pray
that thy wish may be accomplished by my means."
And so it happened. Ibn Tumart returned to his
North African, proclaimed himself a Mahdi, gained
a large following among the Berbers, and overthrew
Ali and the dynasty of the Almoravides. This story
is not entirely beyond doubt, but shows the importance
attached by Ghazzali's contemporaries to his influence
and teaching.</p>

<p>As an example of Ghazzali's ethical earnestness,
we may quote the following from his Ihya-ul-ulum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>("Revival of the religious sciences"). He refers to the
habit common to all Muhammadans of ejaculating,
"We take refuge in God." "By the fear of God,"
he says, "I do not mean a fear like that of women
when their eyes swim and their hearts beat at hearing
some eloquent religious discourse, which they quickly
forget and turn again to frivolity. There is no real
fear at all. He who fears a thing flees from it, and
he who hopes for a thing strives for it, and the only fear
that will save thee is the fear that forbids sinning against
God and instils obedience to Him. Beware of the
shallow fear of women and fools, who, when they hear
of the terrors of the Lord, say lightly, 'We take refuge
in God,' and at the same time continue in the very
sins which will destroy them. Satan laughs at such
pious ejaculations. They are like a man who should
meet a lion in a desert, while there is a fortress at no
great distance away, and when he sees the ravenous
beast, should stand exclaiming, 'I take refuge in that
fortress,' without moving a step towards it. What will
such an ejaculation profit him? In the same way,
merely ejaculating 'I take refuge in God' will not
protect thee from the terrors of His judgment unless
thou really take refuge in Him."</p>

<p>Ghazzali's moral earnestness is equally apparent in
the following extract from his work "Munqidh min
uddallal" "The Deliverance from error," in which
he sets himself to combat the general laxity and heretical
tendencies of his time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Man is composed of a body and a heart; by the
word 'heart' I understand that spiritual part of him
which is the seat of the knowledge of God, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the material organ of flesh and blood which he possesses
in common with the animals. Just as the body flourishes
in health and decays in disease, so the heart is either
spiritually sound or the prey of a malady which ends
in death.</p>

<p>"Now ignorance of God is a deadly poison, and the
revolt of the passions is a disease for which the knowledge
of God and obedience to Him, manifested in
self-control, are the only antidote and remedy. Just
as remedies for the body are only known to physicians
who have studied their secret properties, so the remedies
for the soul are devotional practices as defined by the
prophets, the effects of which transcend reason.</p>

<p>"The proper work of reason is to confess the truth
of inspiration and its own impotence to grasp what is
only revealed to the prophets; reason takes us by the
hand and hands us over to the prophets, as blind men
commit themselves to their guides, or as the desperately
sick to their physicians. Such are the range and limits of
reason; beyond prophetic truth it cannot take a step.</p>

<p>"The causes of the general religious languor and
decay of faith in our time are chiefly to be traced to
four classes of people: (1) Philosophers, (2) Sufis,
(3) Ismailians<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>, (4) the Ulema or scholastic theologians.
I have specially interrogated those who were lax in
their religion; I have questioned them concerning their
doubts, and spoken to them in these terms: 'Why are
you so lukewarm in your religion? If you really
believe in a future life, and instead of preparing for it
sell it in exchange for the goods of this world, you must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>be mad. You would not give two things for one of the
same quality; how can you barter eternity for days
which are numbered? If you do not believe, you are
infidels, and should seek to obtain faith.'</p>

<p>"In answer to such appeals, I have heard men say,
'If the observance of religious practices is obligatory,
it is certainly obligatory on the Ulema or theologians.
And what do we find amongst the most conspicuous
of these? One does not pray, another drinks wine,
a third devours the orphans' inheritance, and a fourth
lets himself be bribed into giving wrong decisions, and
so forth.'</p>

<p>"Another man giving himself out as a Sufi said that
he had attained to such a high pitch of proficiency
in Sufism that for him religious practice was no longer
necessary. An Ismailian said, 'Truth is very difficult
to find, and the road to it is strewn with obstacles; so-called
proofs are mutually contradictory, and the speculations
of philosophers cannot be trusted. But we
have an Imam (leader) who is an infallible judge and
needs no proofs. Why should we abandon truth for
error?' A fifth said, 'I have studied the subject, and
what you call inspiration is really a high degree of
sagacity. Religion is intended as a restraint on the
passions of the vulgar. But I, who do not belong to
the common herd, what have I to do with such stringent
obligations? I am a philosopher; science is my guide,
and dispenses me from submission to authority.'</p>

<p>"This last is the fate of philosophic theists, as we
find it expressed in the writings of Avicenna and Farabi.
It is no rare thing to find men who read the Koran,
attend public worship at the mosque, and outwardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
profess the greatest respect for the religious law, in
private indulging in the use of wine and committing
other shameful actions. If we ask such men how it
comes that although they do not believe in the reality
of inspiration, they attend public worship, they say
that they practise it as a useful exercise and as a safeguard
for their fortunes and families. If we further ask them
why they drink wine, which is absolutely prohibited
in the Koran, they say, "The only object of the prohibition
of wine was to prevent quarrelling and violence.
Wise men like ourselves are in no danger of such excesses,
and we drink in order to brighten and kindle
our imaginative powers.'</p>

<p>"Such is the faith of these pretended Moslems and
their example has led many astray who have been all the
more encouraged to follow these philosophers because
their opponents have often been incompetent."</p>

<p>In the above extracts Ghazzali appears as a reformer,
and it would not be difficult to find modern parallels for
the tendencies which he describes. Professor D.B.
Macdonald compares him to Ritschl in the stress which
he lays on personal religious experience, and in his
suspicion of the intrusion of metaphysics into the
domain of religion. Although intensely in earnest, he was
diffident of his powers as a preacher, and in a surviving
letter says, "I do not think myself worthy to preach;
for preaching is like a tax, and the property on which
it is imposed is the acceptance of preaching to oneself.
He then who has no property, how shall he pay the
tax? and he who lacks a garment how shall he cover
another? and 'When is the stick crooked and the
shadow straight?' And God revealed to Jesus (upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
whom be peace). Preach to thyself, then if thou
acceptest the preaching, preach to mankind, and if
not, be ashamed before Me."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Like other preachers of righteousness, Ghazzali
strove to rouse men out of lethargy by laying stress
on the terrors of the world to come and the Judgment
Day. He was not one of those who think fear too
base a motive to appeal to; he strikes the note of
warning again and again. Towards the close of his
life he composed a short work on eschatology "Al
Durra al Fakhirah" ("The precious pearl") of a sufficiently
lurid character. In it he says: "When you
watch a dead man and see that the saliva has run from
his mouth, that his lips are contracted, his face black,
the whites of his eyes showing, know that he is damned,
and that the fact of his damnation in the other world
has just been revealed to him. But if you see the
dead with a smile on his lips, a serene countenance, his
eyes half-closed, know that he has just received the good
news of the happiness which awaits him in the other life.</p>

<p>"On the Day of Judgment, when all men are gathered
before the throne of God, their accounts are all cast
up, and their good and evil deeds weighed. During
all this time each man believes he is the only one with
whom God is dealing. Though peradventure at the
same moment God is taking account of countless
multitudes whose number is known to Him only.
Men do not see each other, nor hear each other speak."</p>

<p>Regarding faith, Ghazzali says in the Ihya-ul-ulum:</p>

<p>"Faith consists of two elements, patience and
gratitude. Both are graces bestowed by God, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>there is no way to God except faith. The Koran
expounds the excellence of patience in more than
seventy passages. The Caliph Ali said, 'Patience bears
the same relation to faith as the head does to the body.
He who has no head, has no body, and he who has no
patience has no faith.'"</p>

<p>Ghazzali's philosophy is the re-action of his intensely
religious personality against the naturalistic
tendencies of men like Avicenna and Averroes. They
believed in the eternity of matter, and reduced God to
a bare First Cause. He also, though sympathising
with the Sufis, especially on the side of their asceticism,
was opposed to Sufistic Pantheism. He conceived
God chiefly as an active Will, and not merely as the
Self existent.</p>

<p>While his contemporaries were busying themselves
with metaphysical theories concerning matter and
creation, Ghazzali laid stress on self-observation and
self-knowledge ("He who knows himself, knows God").
As St. Augustine found deliverance from doubt and
error in his inward experience of God, and Descartes
in self-consciousness, so Ghazzali, unsatisfied with
speculation and troubled by scepticism, surrenders
himself to the will of God. Leaving others to demonstrate
the existence of God from the external world,
he finds God revealed in the depths of his own consciousness
and the mystery of his own free will.</p>

<p>He fared as innovators in religion and philosophy
always do, and was looked upon during his lifetime as
a heretic. He admits himself that his "Destruction of
the philosophers" was written to expose their mutual
contradictions. But he has no mere Mephistophelic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
pleasure in destruction; he pulls down in order to
erect. He is not a mere sceptic on the one hand,
nor a bigoted theologian on the other, and his verdict
on the Mutazilite heretics of his day is especially mild.
Acute thinker though he was, in him will and feeling
predominated over thought. He rejected the dogmatic
and philosophic systems of his contemporaries as mere
jejune skeletons of reality, and devoted the close
of his life to study of the traditions and the Koran.</p>

<p>Like Augustine, he finds in God-derived self-consciousness
the starting-point for the thought,
and like him emphasizes the fundamental significance
of the will. He sees everywhere the Divine Will at
work in what philosophers call natural causes. He
seeks the truth, but seeks it with a certain consciousness
of possessing it already within himself.</p>

<p>He is a unique and lonely figure in Islam, and has
to this day been only partially understood. In the
Middle Ages his fame was eclipsed by that of Averroes,
whose commentary on Aristotle is alluded to by Dante,
and was studied by Thomas Aquinas and the school-*men.
Averroes' system was rounded and complete,
but Ghazzali was one of those "whose reach exceeds
their grasp"; he was always striking after something
he had not attained, and stands in many respects
nearer to the modern mind than Averroes. Renan,
though far from sympathising with his religious earnestness,
calls him "the most original mind among Arabian
philosophers," and De Boer says, "Men like Ghazzali
have for philosophy this significance that they are a
problem alike for themselves and for philosophy, because
they are a fragment of spiritual reality that requires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
explanation. By the force of their personality they
remove what hinders them in the construction of their
systems without troubling about correctness. Later
thinkers make it their business to explain the impulses
that guide such men both in their work of destruction
and of restoration. Original minds like his supply
food for reflection to future generations."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>FARIDUDDIN ATTAR<br />
<span class="smcap">(ad 1119-1229)</span></h4>


<p>Fariduddin Attar was born in the village of Kerken
near Nishapur in Khorassan, <span class="smcap">a.d. 1119</span> under the Sultan
Sandjar. Some years after his birth his father removed
to Schadbakh, where he kept a druggist's shop.
On his father's death, Fariduddin carried on the business,
whence he received his cognomen Attar (druggist).
His call to the religious life was as follows: One day
while he was seated in his shop surrounded by servants
busily attending to his orders, a wandering dervish
paused at the door and regarded him silently, while
his eyes slowly filled with tears. Attar sharply told
him to be off about his business. "That is easily done,"
replied the dervish; "I have only a light bundle to
carry, nothing in fact but my clothes. But you with
your sacks full of valuable drugs, when the time comes
to go, what will <i>you</i> do? Had you not better consider
a little?" The appeal went home. He promptly
abandoned his business in order to devote himself to
a religious life. Bidding a decisive adieu to the world,
he betook himself to a Sufi convent, presided over by
Sheikh Ruknuddin. Here he resided for some time
engaged in devotional practices, and then made the
pilgrimage to Mecca, where he met with many devotees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and conceived the idea of compiling a collection of
stories of the holy men of Islam. To this work he
devoted several years of his long life; he also composed
a Pand-nama or "Book of Counsels." But the
work by which he is chiefly known is the "Mantiquttair"
or "Parliament of Birds," and of this we proceed
to give some account.</p>

<p>In this allegorical poem various birds representing
mystics, unite themselves under the leadership of the
hoopoe in order to journey to the court of the Simurgh,
a mysterious bird whose name signifies "thirty birds,"
dwelling in Mount Kaf, the mountain which encircles
the world. At the commencement of the poem there
is a long debate between the hoopoe and the other birds,
who at first allege various excuses for not undertaking
the journey, while he rebukes them for their lukewarmness,
not concealing, however, the fact that the
journey is full of peril, and that though many start
few will reach the goal. The hoopoe's description
of the road is as follows: "We have seven valleys
to traverse.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The first is the Valley of Search; the
second the Valley of Love, which has no limits; the
third is the Valley of Knowledge; the fourth is the
Valley of Independence; the fifth is the Valley of
Unity, pure and simple; the sixth is the Valley of
Amazement; last of all is the valley of Poverty and
Annihilation, beyond which there is no advance. There
thou wilt feel thyself drawn, but will have no power
to go any further.</p>

<p>"(1) When thou enterest the Valley of Search, at
every step new trials will present themselves; there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>the parrot of the celestial sphere is as mute as a fly.
There thou must cast away all thy possessions and
imperil all thy riches. Not only must the hand be
empty, but thy heart must be detached from all that
is earthly. Then the Light of the Divine Essence will
begin to cast upon thee some rays.</p>

<p>"(2) In order to enter the second valley (of love) thou
must be made all of fire; he who is not composed of
fire will find no pleasure in that valley; he must not
think of the future, but be ready to sacrifice a hundred
worlds to the flames, if needs be. Faith and infidelity,
good and evil, religion and irreligion, are all one for
him who has arrived at the second stage; for where
love reigns, none of them exist any more.</p>

<p>"(3) In the third valley (of knowledge) the progress
of the pilgrims is in proportion to their innate powers.
In the path traversed by Abraham the Friend of God,
can a feeble spider keep pace with an elephant? Let
the gnat fly as hard as he may, he will never keep up
with the wind. Thus the degrees of knowledge attained
to by the initiated are different; one only reaches the
entrance of the temple, while another finds the Divinity
who dwells in it. When the Sun of Knowledge darts
its rays, each is illumined in proportion to his capacity,
and finds in the contemplation of the truth the
rank which belongs to him. He sees a path lie open
before him through the midst of the fire, the furnace
of the world becomes for him a garden of roses. He
perceives the almond within the shell, that is to say, he
sees God under the veil of all apparent things. But for
one happy man who penetrates into these mysteries,
how many millions have gone astray? Only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
perfect can dive with success into the depths of this
ocean.</p>

<p>"(4) In the fourth valley (of independence) thou
hast done with everything but God. Out of this
disposition of mind, which no longer feels the need
of anything, there rises a tempestuous hurricane,
every blast of which annihilates whole kingdoms.
The seven seas are then no more than a pool of water;
the seven planets are a spark; the eight paradises are
only a single curtain; the seven hells a mass of ice.
In less time than it takes the greedy crow to fill its
crop, out of a hundred caravans of travellers there
remains not one alive.</p>

<p>"(5) The Valley of Unity which succeeds to that of
Independence, is the valley of privation of all things
and reduction to unity, that is to say, the attainment
of a degree of spirituality, in which the Divine Essence,
apart from every attribute, is the object of contemplation.</p>

<p>"(6) In the sixth valley, that of Amazement, the
pilgrim's lot is to suffer and to groan; each breath he
draws is like a sword; his days and nights are passed
in sighs; from each of his hairs distils a drop of blood,
which, as it falls, traces in the air the letters of the word
"alas!" There he remains in a state of stupefaction,
and finds his way no more."</p>

<p>To make the meaning of "Amazement" clearer,
Attar gives the following allegory. He supposes that
the young companions of a princess wished one day to
amuse themselves at the expense of a slave. They
made him drink wine in which they had dropped a
narcotic drug, and when he was asleep had him carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to the harem. At midnight, when he woke, he found
himself on a gilded couch surrounded by perfumed
candles, scent-boxes of aloes, and lovely women whose
songs ravished his ear. "Disconcerted and stupefied,"
says the poet, "he no longer retained reason nor life.
He was no longer in this world, nor was he in the other.
His heart was full of love for the princess, but his tongue
remained mute. His spirit was in ecstacies. When
he awoke in the morning he found himself again a slave at
his old post. The memory of the past night was so
vivid that it caused him to utter a cry; he tore his
garments, and threw dust upon his head. They asked
him what was the matter, but he knew not what to
reply. He could not say whether what he had seen
was a dream or a reality; whether he had passed the
night in drunkenness or in full possession of his faculties.
What he had seen had left a profound impression on
his mind, and yet he could not trace it out accurately.
He had contemplated Beauty beyond all words, and
yet he was not sure whether he had seen It after all.
The only effect of his vision was a trouble of mind
and uncertainty."</p>

<p>(7) At last comes the seventh valley, that of Poverty
and Annihilation. "But these words are insufficient
to describe it; forgetfulness, deafness, dumbness,
fainting&mdash;such is the condition of the pilgrim in this
valley. One sun causes millions of shadows to vanish.
When the ocean is agitated, how can the figures traced
on its waters remain? Such figures are this world
and the world to come, and he who knows them to be
nothing is right. He who is plunged in this sea, where
the heart is astray and lost, has by means of his very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
annihilation found immutable repose. In this ocean,
where reigns a constant calm, the heart finds nought
but annihilation."</p>

<p>Attar also illustrates the Sufi doctrine of annihilation
(which resembles the Buddhistic nirvana) by an allegory.
"One night," he says, "the butterflies were tormented
by the desire to unite themselves with the candle-flame.
They held a meeting, and resolved that one
of them should go and experiment, and bring back
news. A butterfly was sent to a neighbouring house,
and he perceived the flame of the candle which was
burning within. He brought back word and tried to
describe the flame according to the measure of his
intelligence; but the butterfly who presided over the
assembly said that the exploring butterfly had attained
no real knowledge of the candle-flame. A second
butterfly went forth, and approached so close to the
flame as to singe his wings. He also returned, and
threw a little light on the mystery of union with the
flame. But the presiding butterfly found his explanation
not much more satisfactory than the preceding
one.</p>

<p>"A third butterfly then flew forth; he was intoxicated
with love for the flame, and flung himself wholly into
it; he lost himself, and identified himself with it.
It embraced him completely, and his body became as
fiery-red as the flame itself. When the presiding
butterfly saw from afar that the flame had absorbed the
devoted butterfly and communicated its own qualities
to it; 'That butterfly,' he exclaimed, 'has learnt
what he wished to know, but he alone understands it.
Only he who has lost all trace and token of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
existence knows what annihilation is. Until thou
ignorest thyself, body and soul, thou canst not know
the object which deserves thy love.'"</p>

<p>The foregoing terrible description of the seven
mysterious valleys was well calculated to discourage
the birds, and Attar tells us that after hearing it they
stood with hearts oppressed and heads bent. "All
understood," he says, "that it was not for a feeble hand
to bend this bow. They were so terrified by the discourse
of the hoopoe that a great number died on the
spot where they were assembled. As to the others,
in spite of their dismay, they consented to commence
the journey. During long years they travelled over
hill and dale, and spent a great part of their lives in
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>"Finally, of all who set out, a very small band arrived
at the goal. Some were drowned in the ocean, others
were annihilated and disappeared. Others perished
on the peaks of high mountains, devoured by thirst and
a prey to all kinds of ills.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Others had their plumes
burnt and their hearts dried up by the scorching heat
of the sun; others fell a prey to the wild beasts which
haunted the road, falling panic-struck, without
resistance, into their claws; others died of sheer exhaustion
in the desert; others fought and killed each
other madly for chance grains of corn; others experienced
all kinds of pains and fatigues, and ended by stopping
short of the goal; others, engrossed in curiosity and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>pleasure, perished without thinking of the object for
which they had set out.</p>

<p>"When they started, their numbers were countless,
but at last only thirty arrived, and these without
feathers and wings, exhausted and prostrated, their
hearts broken, their souls fainting, their bodies worn
out by fatigue. They had arrived at the Palace of
the Simurgh. A chamberlain of the King, who saw these
thirty hapless birds without feathers or wings,
questioned them whence they came, and why. 'We
have come,' they answered, 'that the Simurgh may become
our king. The love that we feel for him has
unsettled our reason. We have denied ourselves all
rest to follow the road that leads to Him. It is very
long since we started, and of our many millions, only
thirty have reached the goal. The hope of appearing
here has buoyed us up hitherto; may the King think
kindly of the perils we have undergone, and cast upon
us at least a glance of compassion.' The chamberlain
returned a harsh answer, and ordered them to go back,
telling them that the King had no need of their homage.
This answer at first cast them into despair, but afterwards,
imitating the moth which seeks certain death
in the flame of the lamp, they persisted in their request
to be admitted to the presence of the Simurgh. Their
steadfastness did not remain unrewarded. The "chamberlain
of grace" came out, opened a door, and presented
them with a document which he ordered them
to read. This contained a list of all the sins which the
birds had committed against the Simurgh. The perusal
of it caused them nothing less than death, but this
death was for them the birth into a new life."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>Attar says: "By reason of the shame and confusion
which these birds experienced, their bodies became
dust, and their souls were annihilated. When they
were entirely purified from all earthly elements, they
all received a new life. All that they had done or
omitted to do during their earthly existence passed
entirely out of mind. The sun of proximity burnt them,
that is to say, their former existence was consumed by
the sun of the Divine Essence which they had approached,
and a ray of this light produced a life which animated
them all. At this moment they beheld themselves
reflected in the Simurgh.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> When they stole a glance
at Him, He appeared to be the thirty birds themselves;
when they looked at themselves, they seemed to be
the Simurgh; and when they looked at both together,
only one Simurgh appeared. The situation was inexpressible
in words. They were all submerged in an
ocean of stupefaction, with all faculties of thought
suspended. Without moving a tongue, they interrogated
the Awful Presence for an explanation of the
mystery of apparent identity between the Divinity
and his adorers.</p>

<p>"Then a voice was heard saying, 'The Majesty of the
Simurgh is a sun-resembling mirror; whosoever contemplates
Him beholds his own reflection; body and
soul see in Him body and soul. As you are thirty birds,
you appear in this mirror as thirty birds; if forty or
fifty birds came here they would see forty or fifty.
Although you have passed through many changes, it
is yourselves only whom you have seen throughout.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>Can the eye of an ant reach the Pleiades? Then how
can your inch of inkling attain to Us?</p>

<p>"In all the valleys which you have traversed, in all
the acts of kindness which you have done to others,
it was by Our impulse alone that you were acting. All
this while you have been asleep in the Valley of the
Essence and the Attributes. You thirty birds have
been unconscious hitherto. The name "thirty birds"
belongs rather to Us, who are the veritable Simurgh.
Find then in Us a glorious self-effacement, in order to
find yourselves again in us.'</p>

<p>"So they vanished in Him for ever, as the shadow
disappears in the sun. While on pilgrimage they conversed;
when they had arrived, all converse ceased.
There was no longer a guide; there were no longer
pilgrims; the road itself had ceased to be."</p>

<p>Such is this allegory, or Sufi's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
which contains nearly five thousand couplets. Attar
varies the monotony of the long speeches of the Hoopoe
and the other birds by inserting anecdotes, of which
the following is one of the most striking:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">story of the sheikh sanaan.</span></h4>

<p>The Sheikh Sanaan was one of the saints of his age;
four or five times he had made the pilgrimage to Mecca;
his prayers and fasts were countless; no practice enjoined
by the religious law was omitted by him; he
had passed through all the degrees of the spiritual
life; his very breath had a healing influence upon the
sick. In joy and in grief, he was an example for men,
and, as it were, a standard lifted up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>One night, to his distress, he dreamt that he was
fated to leave Mecca (where he was then residing)
for Roum (Asia Minor), and there become an idolator.
When he awoke, he said to his disciples, of whom he
had four hundred, "My decision is taken; I must go
to Roum in order to have this dream explained." His
four hundred disciples accompanied him on the journey.
They went from Mecca to Roum, and traversed the
country from one end to another. One day, by chance
they saw on an elevated balcony a young and lovely
Christian girl. No sooner had the Sheikh seen her than
he became violently in love, and seemed to lose all
regard for his religious duties. His disciples tried to
rouse him out of his perilous state, but in vain. One
said to him, "O thou knower of secrets, rise and perform
thy prayers." He replied, "My 'mihrab'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> is the
face of my Beloved; only thither will I direct my
prayers." Another said, "Dost thou not repent?
Dost thou not preserve any regard for Islam?" "No
one," he said, "repents more deeply than I do for
not having been in love before." A third said, "Anyone
with intelligence can see that though thou wast
our guide, thou hast gone astray." He answered,
"Say what you like, I am not ashamed; I break with
a stone the vase of hypocrisy."</p>

<p>To many similar remonstrances he made similar
replies. At last, finding their efforts of no avail,
his disciples left him. Lost in a kind of stupor,
he remained the whole night motionless before the
balcony.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>
<p>In the morning the young Christian came out, and
seeing that he did not got away, understood that he was
in love. He poured out a passionate appeal, when she
would have dismissed him, and refused to depart. At
last she said, "If thou art really in earnest, thou must
utterly wash thy hands of Islam; thou must bow to
idols,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> burn the Koran, drink wine, and give up thy
religious observances." The Sheikh replied, "I will
drink wine, but I cannot consent to the three other
conditions." She said, "Rise, then, and drink; when
thou hast drunk, thou mayest, perchance, be able."
Accordingly the Sheikh drank wine, and, having done
so, lost his senses entirely, complied with her requests,
and became her abject slave. He then said to her,
"O charming maiden, what remains to be done?
I have drunk wine, I have adored idols; no one could
do more for love than I have done." She, though she
began to requite his affection, wishing still further to
prove him, answered, "Go, then, and feed my swine
for a year, and then we will pass our lives together in
joy or in sorrow."</p>

<p>So this saint and great Sheikh consented to keep
swine for a year. The news of his apostasy spread
all over Roum, and his disciples again came to remonstrate
with him, and said, "O thou who disregardest
religion, return with us again to the Kaaba." The
Sheikh answered, "My soul is full of sadness; go
whither your desires carry you. As for me, the Church
is henceforth my place, and the young Christian the
happiness of my life." He spoke, and turning his face
from his friends, went back to feed his swine. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>wept, and looked at him wistfully from afar. At
last they returned sadly to the Kaaba.</p>

<p>Now there was a friend of the Sheikh, who happened
to have been absent when the Sheikh left Mecca. On
the arrival of the Sheikh's disciples, he questioned
them, and learned all that had happened. He then
said, "If you are really his friends, go and pray to
God night and day for the Sheikh's conversion."
Accordingly, forty days and nights they prayed and
fasted, till their prayers were heard, and God turned
the sheikh's heart back again to Islam. The secrets
of divine wisdom, the Koran, the prophecies, all that
he had blotted out of his mind, came back to his
memory, and at the same time he was delivered from
his folly and his misery. When the fire of repentance
burns, it consumes everything. He made his ablutions,
resumed his Moslem garb, and departed for Mecca,
where he and his old disciples embraced with tears of joy.</p>

<p>In the meantime the young Christian saw the Prophet
appearing to her in a dream, and saying, "Follow the
Sheikh! Adopt his doctrine; be the dust under his
feet. Thou who wert the cause of his apostasy, be
pure as he is." When she awoke from her dream, a
strong impulse urged her to seek for him. With a heart
full of affection, though with a feeble body, she went
to seek for the Sheikh and his disciples. While she
was on the way, an inner voice apprised the Sheikh of
what was passing. "This maiden," it said, "has
abandoned infidelity; she has heard of Our sacred
House,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> she has entered in Our way; thou mayest take
her now, and be blameless."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>
<p>Forthwith, the Sheikh set out on the way towards
Roum to meet her; his disciples essayed to stop him
and said, "Was thy repentance not real? Art thou
turning back again to folly?" But he told them of
the intimation which he had received, and they set
out together till they arrived where the young Christian
was. But they found her prostrate on the ground, her
hair soiled by the dust of the way, her feet bare, her
garments torn. At this sight tears ran down the
Sheikh's cheeks; she, when she saw him, said, "Lift
the veil that I may be instructed, and teach me
Islam."</p>

<p>When this lovely idol had become one of the Faithful,
they shed tears of joy, but she was sad; "O Sheikh!"
she cried, "my powers are exhausted; I cannot support
absence. I am going to leave this dusty and bewildering
world. Farewell, Sheikh Sanaan, farewell! I can say
no more; pardon me and oppose me not." So saying,
her soul left the body; the drop returned to the ocean.</p>

<p>Other anecdotes which occur in the Mantiq-ut-tair
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the angel gabriel and the infidel.</span></h4>

<p>One night Gabriel was near the Throne, when he
heard Allah pronouncing words of acquiescence in
answer to someone's prayer. "A servant of God," said
Gabriel to himself, "is invoking the Eternal just now;
but who is he? All that I can understand is that he
must be a saint of surpassing merit, whose spirit has
entirely subdued his flesh. Gabriel wished to know
who the happy mortal was, but though he flew over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
lands and seas, he did not find him. He hastened
to return to the proximity of the Throne and heard
again the same answer given to the same prayers.
In his anxiety to know the suppliant, he again sought
for him throughout the world, but in vain. Then he
cried, "O God, show me the way that conducts to his
dwelling." "Go," was the answer, "to the country of
Roum; enter a certain Christian convent, and thou
shalt find him." Gabriel hastened thither, and saw
the man who was the object of the divine favour; at
that very moment he was adoring an idol. Then
Gabriel said to God, "O Master of the world, reveal
to me this secret; How canst Thou hear with kindness
him who prays to an idol in a convent?" God answered
him, "A veil is upon his heart; he knows not that he
is astray. Since he has erred through ignorance, I
pardon him, and grant him access to the highest rank
of saints."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the clay of which man is made.</span></h4>

<p>One day the Prophet drank of a stream and found
its taste more sweet than rose-water. As he was sitting
by the stream, someone came and filled his clay pitcher
from it, and the Prophet drank out of that also. To his
amazement, he found the water bitter. "O God,"
he said, "the water of the stream and the water in the
pitcher are one; disclose to me the secret of the difference
in their taste. Why is the water in the pitcher
bitter, and the other sweet as honey?" From the
pitcher itself came the answer. "I am old; the clay
of which I am made has been worked over and over again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
into a thousand shapes. But in every shape I am
impregnated with the bitter savour of mortality. It
exists in me in such a way that the water which I hold
cannot be sweet."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">the dead criminal.</span></h4>

<p>A poor criminal died, and as they were carrying him
to burial, a devotee who was passing by stood aloof,
saying that funeral prayers should not be said over such
an one. The next night, in a dream, the devotee
saw the criminal in heaven, with his face shining like
the sun. Amazed, he said to him, "How hast thou
obtained so lofty a place, thou who hast spent thy life
in crime, and art foul from head to foot?" He answered,
"It is because of thy want of compassion
towards me that God has shown me mercy, though
so great a sinner. Behold the mystery of God's love
and wisdom. In His wisdom, He sends man, like
a child with a lamp, through the night as black as a
raven; immediately afterwards he commands a
furious wind to blow and extinguish the lamp. Then
He asks His child why the lamp is blown out."</p>

<p>"Night and day, O my child, the seven spheres carry
on their revolutions for thee. Heaven and hell are
reflections of thy goodness and of thy wickedness.
The angels have all bowed down to thee.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The part
and whole are lost in thy essence. Do not, therefore,
despise thine own self, for nothing is higher than it.
The body is part of the Whole, and thy soul is the Whole.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>The body is not distinct from the soul, but is a part of
it, neither is the soul distinct from the Whole. It is
for thee that the time arrives when the rose displays
its beauty; for thee that the clouds pour down the
rain of mercy. Whatever the angels do, they have
done for thee."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">anecdote of bayazid bastami.</span></h4>

<p>One night Sheikh Bayazid went out of the town, and
found reigning everywhere profound silence. The
moon was shining at the full, making the night as clear
as day. The sky was covered with constellations, each
fulfilling its course. The Sheikh walked on for a long
while without hearing the least sound, and without
perceiving anyone. He was deeply moved, and said,
"O Lord, my heart is pained. Why is such a sublime
audience-hall as Thine without throngs of worshippers?"
"Cease thy wonder," an inner voice replied to him.
"The King does not accord access to His Court to everyone.
When the sanctuary of Our splendour is displayed,
the careless and the slumbering are without.
Those who are to be admitted to this Court wait whole
years, and then only one in a million enters."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In his latter years, Fariduddin Attar carried his
asceticism to such a degree that he gave up composing
poetry altogether. The story of his death illustrates
in a striking way the indifference to external things
cultivated by the Sufis. During the invasion of Persia
by Jenghiz Khan (<span class="smcap">1229 a.d.</span>) when Attar had reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the great age of 110, he was taken prisoner by the
Mongols. One of them was about to kill him, when
another said, "Let the old man live; I will give a
thousand pieces of silver as his ransom." His captor
was about to close with the bargain, but Attar said,
"Don't sell me so cheaply; you will find someone
willing to give more." Subsequently another man
came up and offered a bag of straw for him. "Sell
me to him," said Attar, "for that is all I am worth."
The Mongol, irritated at the loss of the first offer, slew
the saint, who thus found the death he desired.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h4>SUHRAWARDY<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a><br />
<span class="smcap">(1153-1191 ad)</span></h4>


<p>Very few remains in writing, except their Persian
poems, have come down to us from the older Pantheistic
mystics. In the Kingdom of the Caliphs heretical
books were suppressed by stronger measures than being
placed on the Index. To express views openly at
variance with the established religion was to imperil
one's life. The Persian Sufis, therefore, who in their
mystical works generally used Arabic, veiled their views
in a sort of technical language, which was quite unintelligible
to the uninitiated. Still some works are
preserved which give us an insight into their tendencies.</p>

<p>The Sheikh Suhrawardy, who was a martyr to his
convictions, must be regarded as the chief representative
of this freethinking tendency in Sufism. His works
have been more appreciated by the Persians and Turks
than by the Arabs, among whom copies of them are
no longer to be found, while they may be met with in
Turkish libraries.</p>

<p>Suhrawardy belonged to the orthodox school of the
Shafiites, and gained a great reputation for his learning.
He studied jurisprudence in Maraghah, then went to
Ispahan, and later to Bagdad and Aleppo, where he
occupied himself chiefly with philosophical studies.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>He gave himself the title "Disciple of the Spirit-world."
In the Arabic biographies of him, his teaching
is said to have aimed at overthrowing Islam; this,
however, is always said of anyone who ventures to oppose
the dominant orthodox party. As a matter of fact,
he founded a sect who bore the name Ishrakiyya&mdash;"The
Illumined." For them he composed a work,
"Hikmat al Ishrak," <i>i.e.</i>, "The philosophy of illumination,"
containing mystical and fantastic teaching.
In Aleppo, where he finally took up his abode, he seems
to have exercised a powerful influence on Prince Malik
Zahir, the son of the famous Saladin. The orthodox
party persuaded the latter to pass sentence of death on
him as a heretic, which sentence Malik Zahir caused to
be carried out (<span class="smcap">1191 a.d.</span>), but not till he had received
a threatening letter from his father for his dilatoriness.
Suhrawardy is said when he heard the sentence, to have
quoted a Persian verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is not worth while to draw the sword."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>By his own consent, he was then shut up in a separate
chamber and deprived of meat and drink till he passed
into the world for which he longed. His tomb is still
preserved in Aleppo, where the memory of him as
"the murdered Suhrawardy" has by no means faded.
The inhabitants say that no tree or shrub will grow in
the tomb-enclosure. His real character has, for the
most part, been forgotten, and he is represented as a
magician and sorcerer who possessed the philosopher's
stone, and knew how to make gold. Many even believe
that he was never killed at all, but disappeared, while
a phantom was put to death in his place. They say
that at night weird sounds are heard from his grave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>These popular legends give us reason to suppose that
Suhrawardy's life and death in Aleppo really made
an extraordinary impression on the people, and that
his teaching penetrated more deeply than Muhammedan
writers find convenient to admit. Suhrawardy's
writings were preserved from entire destruction by the
Persians and Turks. The most important of them
are the above-mentioned Hikmat al Ishrak, Haikal-un-nur
(The Temple of Light) and others. From the two
first a few passages may be quoted, which suffice to show
that the theosophy of this Persian Sufi took a much
bolder flight than that of the Arabian Sufis, and that
for it Islam was a mere outward form.</p>

<p>In the Hikmat al Ishrak we find the influences of
two entirely different schools of thought fantastically
blended into an extraordinary compound of philosophy
and mysticism. In this, Neo-platonic ideas are brought
into connection with a theory of light obviously derived
from Zoroastrian doctrine, and both are variously
modified by the influence of Islamic monotheism and
presented in the abstract terminology of the Arabic
Sufis. With these last, Suhrawardy found himself in
harmony with regard to their "ecstatic" stages and
arrival at the knowledge of God by way of intuition.
He also betrays the influence of the Perso-Shiite dogma
of the hidden spiritual Imams, of whom only one is
believed to be on earth at any given time, and he
is the highest spiritual and religious authority among
his contemporaries.</p>

<p>The following is an abridged translation of the preface
to the "Hikmat al Ishrak": "Long have ye, O worthy
friends and companions&mdash;may God protect you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>prayed
me to write for you a book wherein I should
describe what has been revealed to me by way of inspiration
in my lonely contemplations and soul-combats.
Spiritual science is no class privilege reserved for the
elect, behind whom the doors of the spirit-world are
closed, and thereby he who would learn somewhat of
the supernatural is excluded. Nay, He who graciously
granted us this knowledge, He, the Horizon of Illumination,
is not miserly with the secrets of the other world.
The worst of all ages is that in which the carpet of
free spiritual investigation is rolled up, the wings of
thought are cramped, the gates of intuition closed and
the road of contemplation barricaded.</p>

<p>"The world was never wholly without philosophy,
and without someone who cultivated it and was declared
a philosopher by manifest proofs and facts. This man
is the real Caliph or representative of God on earth,
and his successors will be so, as long as heaven and earth
shall endure. The difference between the old and
new philosophers only consists in the variations of
their phraseology and of their methods of exposition
and proof. All in common acknowledge the three
worlds (the earthly world, the spirit world, and the
world of Deity); all alike are agreed in Monotheism and
in their fundamental principles.</p>

<p>"As regards the first teacher, Aristotle, it is clear
that he is of incomparable value, that his wisdom is
great and his faculty of penetration profound; yet we
should not so exaggerate our reverence for him as to
undervalue his masters, among whom especially are
to be counted the travelling and law-giving philosophers,
such as Agathod&aelig;mon, Hermes, &AElig;sculapius and others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
The line of their succession is long; the chief classes
into which they may be divided are as follows: (1) The
Theosophist without philosophy; (2) the speculative
philosopher without theosophy; (3) the philosopher who
is equally strong in both; (4) the Theosophist who is
strong in theosophy but mediocre or weak in philosophy;
(5) the philosopher who is strong in philosophy but
mediocre or weak in theosophy, etc. Now if the
complete mastery of both philosophic and theosophic
science is found in one man, <i>this</i> man is the representative
of God on earth. Failing such a person, the title
devolves on him who is complete in theosophy, though
he may be mediocre in philosophy. Failing him,
the representative of God is he who is complete in
theosophy without possessing any philosophy at all.
There never fails to be in the world <i>one</i> great theosophist.</p>

<p>"But the speculative philosopher, fully equipped
in philosophy, has no claim to the rule in this earth.
For there is always a theosophist on earth and he is
better fitted for the post than the philosopher, as the
place of God's Vicar on earth cannot remain unoccupied.
By this 'rule,' however, I do not mean the possession of
political power; only the Imam who is also a theosophist
<i>may</i> take over the political power and exercise it publicly,
or he may rule in secret. In the latter case he is termed the
mystical pole ("qutb"); to him the rule belongs, even
though he live in the deepest poverty. If the political
power should really come into his hand, the age becomes
illuminated; but if it lacks such divine guidance, it is
overwhelmed by darkness.</p>

<p>"It is nobler to aim at a high attainment at theosophy
and philosophy alike than to confine one's effort to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
one or the other. This book is intended for those who
devote themselves to both, and not to the latter only;
in it we address ourselves only to the untrammelled
thinker in the reign of theosophy; the lowest step which
the reader of it should have attained, if he would derive
any benefit therefrom, is at any rate to have felt a flash
of the divine light reach him, and in some measure to
have made it his own. Whoever merely wishes to
study philosophy, let him attend the school of the
Peripatetics; for that purpose it is good and sufficient.
Just as we form certain sense-perceptions and recognise
their conditions with certainty, and base further
scientific investigations upon them, so in the spiritual
realm we form certain perceptions and build upon
them; but he who does not adopt this method, understands
nothing of philosophy."</p>

<p>Continuing, he assumes a peculiar theory of light,
which betrays a really Persian origin. One special
light he designates by the old Persian word "Isfahbad."
The Godhead Itself he calls the "light of lights."
In other places he borrows from Neo-Platonism. He
assumes a region in the heavenly spheres where the
ideal prototypes of existing things are found. The
saints and devout ascetics, according to him, have the
power to call those ideal prototypes into real existence,
and these can produce at their wish, food, figures or
melodies, etc.</p>

<p>Suhrawardy's optimistic way of conceiving the world
is peculiar for a Moslem. While Islam regards the
world as a vale of tears, and earthly life as a time of
temptation, he finds the evil in this world much less
than the good. The following sentences of his work are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
noteworthy: "Know that souls in whom the heavenly
illuminations are lasting, reduce the material world
to obedience. Their supplication is heard in the Upper
World, and fate has already decreed that the supplication
of such a person for such an object should be heard.
The light which streams from the highest world is the
Elixir of power and knowledge and the world obeys it.
In the purified souls is reproduced a reflex of God's
light, and a creative ray is focussed in them. The
'evil eye' is only a light-power, which influences objects
and injures them." Soon after Suhrawardy had been
put to death, nearly the whole of his books were committed
to the flames by order to the Caliph Nasir.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>JALALUDDIN RUMI</h4>


<p>Jalaluddin Rumi has been called by Professor Eth&eacute;
(in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>) "the greatest pantheistic
writer of all ages." However that may be, he
is certainly the greatest mystical poet of Persia, though
not so well known in Europe as Saadi, Hafiz and Omar
Khayyam. Saadi, Jalaluddin's contemporary, seems to
have been conscious of this, for when asked by the Prince
of Shiraz to send him the finest poem which had been
published in Persia, he sent an ode from Jalaluddin's
"Diwan."</p>

<p>Jalaluddin ("the glory of religion") was born at
Balkh, in Central Asia (1207 AD), where his father,
Behauddin, was a professor of theology under the
Sultan Khwarezm Shah. His discourses were largely
attended by great and small, but for some reason he
seems to have excited the Sultan's displeasure. He
therefore left Balkh with the whole of his family and
dependants, taking an oath not to return thither while
the Sultan was on the throne. Behauddin's way
led him to Nishapur, where he met the Sheikh Fariddudin
Attar, who, pointing to Jalaluddin, said, "Take
care! This son of yours will light a great flame in the
world." Attar also presented the boy with his <i>Asrarnama</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>or "book of secrets." In every town which
they visited the chief men came to see Behauddin and
listened to his teaching. Behauddin and his son made
the pilgrimage to Mecca, after which the former settled
at Konia (Iconium), in Asia Minor ("Roum"), whence
the poet received the title "Rumi." Here Behauddin
obtained as great a reputation as he had done at Balkh,
and on his death Jalaluddin succeeded him as "Sheikh,"
or spiritual instructor. He soon grew tired of the
ordinary round of Mohammedan learning and gave himself
up to mysticism. This tendency of his received an
additional impulse from the arrival in Iconium of an
extraordinary man, the fakir Shams-i-Tabriz, a disciple
of the celebrated Sheikh Ruknuddin.</p>

<p>One day Ruknuddin, when conversing with Shams-i-Tabriz,
had said to him, "In the land of Roum is a
Sufi who glows with divine love; thou must go thither
and fan this glow to a clear flame." Shams-i-Tabriz
immediately went to Iconium. On his arrival he
met Jalaluddin riding on a mule in the midst of a
throng of disciples who were escorting him from the
lecture hall to his house. He at once intuitively
recognised that here was the object of his search and
his longing. He therefore went straight up to him
and asked, "What is the aim of all the teaching that
you give, and all the religious exercises which you
practise?" "The aim of my teaching," answered
Jalaluddin, "is the regulation of conduct as prescribed
by the traditions and the moral and religious law."
"All this," answered Shams-i-Tabriz, "is mere skimming
the surface." "But what then is under the surface?"
asked Jalaluddin. "Only complete union of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
knower with the known is knowledge," answered
Shams-i-Tabriz and quoted the following verse of
Hakim Sanai:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only when knowledge frees thee from thyself,</span>
<span class="i1">Is such knowledge better than ignorance.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>These words made a most powerful impression on
Jalaluddin, so that he plied Shams-i-Tabriz with questions
and resorted with him to lonely desert places for uninterrupted
converse. This led to a neglect of teaching
on his part, and his pupils and adherents persecuted and
ridiculed Shams-i-Tabriz, calling him "a bare-footed
and bare-headed fakir, who has come hither to lead
the pattern of believers astray." Their treatment
caused Shams-i-Tabriz to flee to his native city without
telling Jalaluddin. The latter, however, overcome
by love and longing, went after him, found him and
persuaded him to return.</p>

<p>Shams-i-Tabriz did so, and for some time longer they
lived in friendly intercourse together; but Jalaluddin's
disciples again began to persecute the former, who
departed to Syria, where he remained two years.
During this interval, in order to soften the pain of
separation, Jalaluddin instituted mystical dances, which
he ordered to be accompanied by the flute. This was
the beginning of the celebrated order of Mevlevis, or
dancing dervishes, which has now existed for over
six hundred years, successively presided over by
descendants of Jalaluddin. Their gyrations are intended
to symbolise the wheelings of the planets round
their central sun and the attraction of the creature to
the Creator. They exist in large numbers in Turkey,
and to this day the coronation of the Sultan of Turkey is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
not considered complete till he is girded with a sword
by the head dervish of the Mevlevi order.</p>

<p>Shams-i-Tabriz subsequently returned to Konia and
perished there in a tumult, the details of which are not
known. To commemorate his friend Jalaluddin composed
his "Diwan-i-Shams-i-Tabriz," putting the latter's
name in place of his own as the author. It is a collection
of spirited odes setting forth the doctrines of Sufistic
Pantheism. The following lines on pilgrimage to the
Kaaba afford a good instance of the way in which
the Sufi poets endeavour to spiritualise the rites
of Islam:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beats there a heart within that breast of thine,</span>
<span class="i0">Then compass reverently its sacred shrine:</span>
<span class="i0">For the essential Kaaba is the heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And no proud pile of perishable art.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">When God ordained the pilgrim rite, that sign</span>
<span class="i0">Was meant to lead thy thoughts to things divine;</span>
<span class="i0">A thousand times <i>he</i> treads that round in vain</span>
<span class="i0">Who gives one human heart a needless pain.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">Leave wealth behind; bring God thy heart, Whose light</span>
<span class="i0">Will guide thy footsteps through the gloomiest night</span>
<span class="i0">God spurns the riches of a thousand coffers,</span>
<span class="i0">And says, 'The saint is he his heart who offers;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor gold nor silver seek I, but above</span>
<span class="i0">All gifts the heart, and buy it with My love:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea! one sad, contrite heart which men despise</span>
<span class="i0">More than My throne and fixed decree I prize';</span>
<span class="i0">The meanest heart that ever man has spurned</span>
<span class="i0">Is a clear glass where God may be discerned.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following ode, translated by the late Professor
Falconer, is frankly pantheistic:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>
<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And Being was none, save the Presence Divine.</span>
<span class="i0">Named and name were alike emanations from Me,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere aught that was 'I' yet existed, or 'We';</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the veil of the flesh for Messiah was wrought,</span>

</div>

<p>Jalaluddin's chief work, the Masnavi, containing
upwards of 26,000 couplets, was undertaken at the
instance of one of his disciples and intimates, Husam-ud-din,
who had often urged him to put his teaching
into a written form. One day when Husam-ud-din
pressed the subject upon him, Jalaluddin drew from
his turban a paper containing the opening couplets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>of the Masnavi, which are thus translated by Mr.
Whinfield:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hearken to the reed flute, how it discourses,</span>
<span class="i0">When complaining of the pains of separation:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">'Ever since they tore me from my ozier-bed,</span>
<span class="i0">My plaintive notes have moved men and women to tears.</span>
<span class="i0">I burst my breast, striving to give vent to sighs,</span>
<span class="i0">And to express the pangs of my yearning for my home.</span>
<span class="i0">He who abides far away from his home</span>
<span class="i0">Is ever longing for the day he shall return;</span>
<span class="i0">My wailing is heard in every throng,</span>
<span class="i0">In concert with them that rejoice and them that weep.'</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reed flute is one of the principal instruments in
the melancholy music which accompanies the dancing of
the Mevlevi dervishes. It is a picture of the Sufi or
enlightened man, whose life is, or ought to be, one long
lament over his separation from the Godhead, for which
he yearns till his purified spirit is re-absorbed into
the Supreme Unity. We are here reminded of the
words of Novalis, "Philosophy is, properly speaking,
home sickness; the wish to be everywhere at
home."</p>

<p>Briefly speaking, the subject of the Masnavi may be
said to be the love of the soul for God as its Origin, to
Whom it longs to return, not the submission of the
ordinary pious Moslem to the iron despotism of Allah.
This thesis is illustrated with an extraordinary wealth
of imagery and apologue throughout the six books
composing the work. The following fable illustrates
the familiar Sufi doctrine that all religions are the same
to God, Who only regards the heart:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>
<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Moses, to his horror, heard one summer day</span>
<span class="i0">A benighted shepherd blasphemously pray:</span>
<span class="i0">'Lord!' he said, 'I would I knew Thee, where Thou art,</span>
<span class="i0">That for Thee I might perform a servant's part;</span>
<span class="i0">Comb Thy hair and dust Thy shoes and sweep Thy room,</span>
<span class="i0">Bring Thee every morning milk and honeycomb.'</span>
<span class="i0">Moses cried: 'Blasphemer! curb thy blatant speech!</span>
<span class="i0">Whom art thou addressing? Lord of all and each,</span>

<span class="i0">Miscreant, have a care, lest thunderbolts should break</span>
<span class="i0">On our heads and others perish for thy sake.</span>
<span class="i0">Without eyes He seeth, without ears He hears,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath no son nor partner through the endless years,</span>
<span class="i0">Space cannot contain Him, time He is above,</span>
<span class="i0">All the limits that He knows are Light and Love.'</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">Put to shame, the shepherd, his poor garment rent,</span>
<span class="i0">Went away disheartened, all his ardour spent.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">Then spake God to Moses: 'Why hast thou from Me</span>
<span class="i0">Driven away My servant, who goes heavily?</span>
<span class="i0">Not for severance it was, but union,</span>
<span class="i0">I commissioned thee to preach, O hasty one!</span>
<span class="i0">Hatefullest of all things is to Me divorce,</span>
<span class="i0">And the worst of all ways is the way of force.</span>
<span class="i0">I made not creation, Self to aggrandize,</span>
<span class="i0">But that creatures might with Me communion prize.</span>
<span class="i0">What though childish tongues trip? 'Tis the heart I see,</span>
<span class="i0">If it really loves Me in sincerity.</span>
<span class="i0">Blood-stains of the martyrs no ablution need,</span>
<span class="i0">Some mistakes are better than a cautious creed,</span>

<span class="i0">Is it much to Him Who spirits doth discern?</span>
<span class="i0">Love's religion comprehends each creed and sect,</span>
<span class="i0">Love flies straight to God, and outsoars intellect.</span>
<span class="i0">If the gem be real, what matters the device?</span>
<span class="i0">Love in seas of sorrow finds the pearl of price.'</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>
<p>A similar lesson is taught by the apologue of the
"Elephant in the Dark":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During the reign of an Eastern sovereign, he remarked that
the learned men of his time differed widely in their estimate of
the Deity, each ascribing to Him different characteristics.
So he had an elephant brought in secret to his capital and
placed in a dark chamber; then, inviting those learned men,
he told them that he was in possession of an animal which none
of them had ever seen. He requested them to accompany him
to the chamber, and, on entering it, said that the animal was
before them, and asked if they could see it. Being answered
in the negative, he begged them to approach and feel it, which
they did, each touching it in a different part. After returning
to the light, he asked them what they thought the animal
was really like. One declared that it was a huge column,
another that it was a rough hide, a third that it was of ivory,
a fourth that it had huge flaps of some coarse substance; but
not one could correctly state what the animal was. They
returned to the chamber, and when the light was let in, those
learned men beheld for the first time the object of their curiosity,
and learned that, whilst each was correct in what he had
said, all differed widely from the truth.</p></div>

<p>Though a pantheist, Jalaluddin lays great stress
on the fact of man's sinfulness and frailty and on the
personality of the Devil, as in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a net the Devil spreads, weaving snare on snare,</span>
<span class="i0">We, like foolish birds, are caught captive unaware;</span>
<span class="i0">From one net no sooner free, straightway in another</span>
<span class="i0">We are tangled, fresh defeats aspirations smother;</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till upon the ground we lie, helpless as a stone,</span>
<span class="i0">We, who might have gained the sky, we, who might have flown.</span>
<span class="i0">When we seek to house our grain, pile a goodly store,</span>
<span class="i0">Pride, a hidden mouse, is there nibbling evermore;</span>
<span class="i0">Till upon the harvest day, lo, no golden heap,</span>
<span class="i0">But a mildewed mass of chaff maggots overcreep.</span>
<span class="i0">Many a brilliant spark is born where the hammers ply,</span>
<span class="i0">But a lurking thief is there; prompt, with finger sly,</span>
<span class="i0">Spark on spark he puts them out, sparks which might have soared</span>
<span class="i0">Perish underneath his touch. Help us then, O Lord!</span>
<span class="i0">What with gin and trap and snare, pitfall and device,</span>
<span class="i0">How shall we poor sinners reach Thy fair paradise?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, in contradiction to logical pantheism Jalaluddin
lays stress on man's free-will and responsibility,
as in the following illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the frontier set, the warden of a fort,</span>
<span class="i0">Far from his monarch and his monarch's court,</span>
<span class="i0">Holds the fort, let foemen bluster as they may,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor for fear or favour will his trust betray;</span>
<span class="i0">Far from his monarch, on the empire's edge,</span>
<span class="i0">He, with his master, keeps unbroken pledge;</span>
<span class="i0">Surely then his lord his worth will higher own,</span>
<span class="i0">Than their prompt obedience who surround his throne;</span>
<span class="i0">In the Master's absence a little work done well</span>
<span class="i0">Weighs more than a great one when his eyes compel;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now</i> is the time to show who faith and trust will keep,</span>
<span class="i0">Once probation over, faith and trust are cheap.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>However much individual Sufis may have fallen into
Antinomianism and acted as if there was no essential
difference between good and evil, the great Sufi teachers
have always enjoined self-mortification, quoting the
saying, "Die before you die." This dying is divided
by them into three kinds: "black death" (suffering
oppression from others), "red death" (mortifying the
flesh), and "white death" (suffering hunger). Jalaluddin
illustrates this by the following parable:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>
<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A merchant from India a parrot had brought,</span>
<span class="i0">And pent in a narrow cage, sorrow-distraught</span>
<span class="i0">With longing for freedom. One day the good man</span>
<span class="i0">Determined to try with his wares Hindustan;</span>
<span class="i0">So he said to his parrot, 'What gift shall I bring</span>
<span class="i0">From the land you were born in&mdash;what curious thing?'</span>
<span class="i0">The parrot replied, 'There are kinsfolk of mine</span>
<span class="i0">Flying blithe in those woods, for whose freedom I pine;</span>
<span class="i0">(Oh, the green woods of India!). Go, tell them my state&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A captive in grip of implacable fate&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And say, "Is it justice that I should despair</span>
<span class="i0">While you, where you list, can flash swift through the air,</span>
<span class="i0">Can peck at the pineapples, bathe in the springs,</span>
<span class="i0">And spread in the sunlight your green-gleaming wings?"</span>
<span class="i0">His message the man took, and made his word good</span>
<span class="i0">When he came where the parrots flew free in the wood;</span>
<span class="i0">But no sooner the message was given than one</span>
<span class="i0">Like lead to the earth fell as dead as a stone.</span>
<span class="i0">The merchant upbraided himself, 'It is clear</span>
<span class="i0">This parrot of mine was a relative dear,</span>
<span class="i0">And the shock has been fatal; myself am to blame.'</span>
<span class="i0">When his journey was finished and homeward he came,</span>
<span class="i0">His parrot inquired, 'Hast brought me a crumb</span>
<span class="i0">Of comfort in sorrow where, caged, I sit dumb?'</span>
<span class="i0">The merchant said, 'No; 'twas a pity you sent,</span>
<span class="i0">For the message you gave proved of fatal content;</span>
<span class="i0">As soon as I gave it one shuddered and fell</span>
<span class="i0">Stone-dead, as if struck by some magical spell.'</span>
<span class="i0">No sooner that bird's fate it heard, than his own</span>
<span class="i0">On the floor of its cage fell as dead as a stone.</span>
<span class="i0">'Alas!' cried the merchant, 'my own bird I've killed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">My own pretty parrot, so Allah has willed!'</span>
<span class="i0">Sadly out from the cage the dead body he drew,</span>
<span class="i0">When, to his amazement, straight upwards it flew</span>
<span class="i0">And perched on a tree. 'Lo! the message,' he said,</span>
<span class="i0">'My friend sent&mdash;"Die thou, as I make myself dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And by dying win freedom." Farewell, master dear,</span>
<span class="i0">I caught the plain hint with intelligence clear.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself reckon dead, and then thou shalt fly</span>
<span class="i0">Free, free, from the prison of earth to the sky!</span>
<span class="i0">Spring may come, but on granite will grow no green thing;</span>
<span class="i0">It was barren in winter, 'tis barren in spring;</span>
<span class="i0">And granite man's heart is, till grace intervene,</span>
<span class="i0">And, crushing it, clothe the long barren with green.</span>
<span class="i0">When the fresh breath of Jesus shall touch the heart's core,</span>
<span class="i0">It will live, it will breathe, it will blossom once more.'</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last couplet is a good illustration of the different
ways in which Christ is regarded by the Sufi poets
and by Mohammed in the Koran. In the latter, it
is true, He is acknowledged as the Word of God and the
Spirit of God, but His work among men is done,
having been entirely superseded by the coming of
Mohammed, the last and greatest of the prophets.
Jalaluddin on the other hand, as in the above couplet,
speaks of Christ as still exercising healing influences.
Elsewhere he says, referring to the Gospel narrative
of Christ's entry into Jerusalem (not mentioned in
the Koran), and taking the ass as the symbol of the
body pampered by the sensualist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You deserted Jesus, a mere ass to feed,</span>
<span class="i0">In a crowd of asses you would take the lead;</span>
<span class="i0">Those who follow Jesus, win to wisdom's ranks;</span>
<span class="i0">Those who fatten asses get a kick for thanks.</span>
<span class="i0">Pity keep for Jesus, pity not the ass,</span>
<span class="i0">Let not fleshly impulse intellect surpass.</span>
<span class="i0">If an ass could somewhat catch of Jesus' mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Classed among the sages he himself would find;</span>
<span class="i0">Though because of Jesus you may suffer woe,</span>
<span class="i0">Still from Him comes healing, never let Him go.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another place, speaking of the importance of
controlling the tongue because of the general sensitiveness
of human nature, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>
<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In each human spirit is a Christ concealed,</span>
<span class="i0">To be helped or hindered, to be hurt or healed;</span>
<span class="i0">If from any human soul you lift the veil</span>
<span class="i0">You will find a Christ there hidden without fail;</span>
<span class="i0">Woe, then, to blind tyrants whose vindictive ire,</span>
<span class="i0">Venting words of fury, sets the world on fire.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But though he speaks with reverence of Christ, he
shares the common Mohammedan animus against St.
Paul. As a matter of fact St. Paul is rarely mentioned
in Mohammedan writings, but Jalaluddin spent most
of his life at Iconium, where, probably, owing to the
tenacity of Oriental tradition, traces of St. Paul's
teaching lingered. In the first book of the Masnavi
a curious story is told of an early corrupter of Christianity
who wrote letters containing contradictory doctrines
to the various leaders of their Church, and brought the
religion into confusion. In this case Jalaluddin seems
to have neglected the importance of distinguishing
between second-hand opinion and first-hand knowledge,
on which he elsewhere lays stress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Knowledge hath two wings, Opinion hath but one,</span>
<span class="i0">And opinion soon fails in its orphan flight;</span>
<span class="i0">The bird with one wing soon droops its head and falls,</span>
<span class="i0">But give it two wings and it gains its desire.</span>
<span class="i0">The bird of Opinion flies, rising and falling,</span>
<span class="i0">On its wing in vain hope of its rest;</span>
<span class="i0">But when it escapes from Opinion and Knowledge receives it,</span>
<span class="i0">It gains its two wings and spreads them wide to heaven;</span>
<span class="i0">On its two wings it flies like Gabriel</span>
<span class="i0">Without doubt or conjecture, and without speech or voice.</span>
<span class="i0">Though the whole world should shout beneath it,</span>
<span class="i0">'Thou art in the road to God and the perfect faith,'</span>
<span class="i0">It would not become warmer at their speech,</span>
<span class="i0">And its lonely soul would not mate with theirs;</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
<span class="i0">And though they should shout to it, 'Thou hast lost thy way;</span>
<span class="i0">And thinkest thyself a mountain and art but a leaf,'</span>
<span class="i0">It would not lose its convictions from their censure,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor vex its bosom with their loud reproof;</span>
<span class="i0">And though sea and land should join in concert,</span>
<span class="i0">Exclaiming, 'O wanderer, thou hast lost thy road!'</span>
<span class="i0">Not an atom of doubt would fall into its soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor a shade of sorrow at the scorner's scorn.</span>
<span class="i10">(<i>Professor Cowell's translation</i>.)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like all quietists, Jalaluddin dwells on the importance
of keeping the mind unclouded by anger and resentment,
as in the following little parable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One day a lion, looking down a well,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw what appeared to him a miracle,</span>
<span class="i0">Another lion's face that upward glared</span>
<span class="i0">As if the first to try his strength he dared.</span>
<span class="i0">Furious, the lion took a sudden leap</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er him closed the placid waters deep.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou who dost blame injustice in mankind,</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but the image of thine own dark mind;</span>
<span class="i0">In them reflected clear thy nature is</span>
<span class="i0">With all its angles and obliquities.</span>
<span class="i0">Around thyself thyself the noose hast thrown,</span>
<span class="i0">Like that mad beast precipitate and prone;</span>
<span class="i0">Face answereth to face, and heart to heart,</span>
<span class="i0">As in the well that lion's counterpart.</span>
<span class="i0">'Back to each other we reflections throw,'</span>
<span class="i0">So spake Arabia's Prophet long ago;</span>
<span class="i0">And he, who views men through self's murky glass,</span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims himself no lion, but an ass.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Ghazzali had done before him, Jalaluddin sees
in the phenomena of sleep a picture of the state of mind
which should be cultivated by the true Sufi, "dead to
this world and alive to God":&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>
<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Every night, O God, from the net of the body</span>
<span class="i0">Thou releasest our souls and makest them like blank tablets;</span>
<span class="i0">Every night thou releasest them from their cages</span>
<span class="i0">And settest them free: none is master or slave.</span>
<span class="i0">At night the prisoners forget their prisons,</span>
<span class="i0">At night the monarchs forget their wealth:</span>
<span class="i0">No sorrow, no care, no profit, no loss,</span>
<span class="i0">No thought or fear of this man or that.</span>
<span class="i0">Such is the state of the Sufi in this world,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the seven sleepers<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> he sleeps open-eyed,</span>
<span class="i0">Dead to worldly affairs, day and night,</span>
<span class="i0">Like a pen held in the hand of his Lord.&mdash;(<i>Professor Cowell</i>.)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we have seen, Jalaluddin's conception of God is
a far higher one than is embodied in the orthodox formula
of the Koran, "Say: God is One. He neither begetteth
nor is begotten." With Jalaluddin God is far more
immanent than transcendent. In one place he says,
"He who beholdeth God is godlike," and in another,
"Our attributes are copies of His attributes." In a
remarkable passage anticipating the theory of Evolution
he portrays man ascending through the various stages
of existence back to his Origin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">From the inorganic we developed into the vegetable kingdom,</span>
<span class="i1">Dying from the vegetable we rose to animal,</span>
<span class="i1">And leaving the animal, we became man.</span>
<span class="i1">Then what fear that death will lower us?</span>
<span class="i1">The next transition will make us an angel,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shall we rise from angels and merge in the Nameless,</span>
<span class="i0">All existence proclaims, "Unto Him shall we return."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Soul becomes pregnant by the Soul of souls</span>
<span class="i1">And brings forth Christ;</span>
<span class="i1">Not that Christ Who walked on land and sea,</span>
<span class="i0">But that Christ Who is above space.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
The work of man in this world is to polish his soul
from the rust of concupiscence and self-love, till, like
a clear mirror, it reflects God. To this end he must
bear patiently the discipline appointed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If thou takest offence at every rub,</span>
<span class="i0">How wilt thou become a polished mirror?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He must choose a "pir," or spiritual guide who may
represent the Unseen God for him; this guide he must
obey and imitate not from slavish compulsion, but
from an inward and spontaneous attraction, for though
it may be logically inconsistent with Pantheism, Jalaluddin
is a thorough believer in free-will. Love is
the keynote of all his teaching, and without free-will
love is impossible. Alluding to the ancient oriental
belief that jewels are formed by the long-continued
action of the sun on common stones, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For as a stone, so Sufi legends run,</span>
<span class="i0">Wooed by unwearied patience of the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Piercing its dense opacity, has grown</span>
<span class="i0">From a mere pebble to a precious stone,</span>
<span class="i0">Its flintiness impermeable and crass</span>
<span class="i0">Turned crystalline to let the sunlight pass;</span>
<span class="i0">So hearts long years impassive and opaque</span>
<span class="i0">Whom terror could not crush nor sorrow break,</span>
<span class="i0">Yielding at last to love's refining ray</span>
<span class="i0">Transforming and transmuting, day by day,</span>
<span class="i0">From dull grown clear, from earthly grown divine,</span>
<span class="i0">Flash back to God the light that made them shine.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jalaluddin did not live to finish the Masnavi, which
breaks off abruptly near the end of the sixth book.
He died in 1272, seven years after Dante's birth. His
last charge to his disciples was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>I bid you fear God openly and in secret, guard against excess
in eating, drinking and speech; keep aloof from evil companionship;
be diligent in fasts and self-renunciation and bear wrongs
patiently. The best man is he who helps his fellow-men, and
the best speech is a brief one which leads to knowledge. Praise
be to God alone!</p></div>

<p>He is buried at Iconium, and his tomb, like those of
all Mohammedan saints, in a greater or lesser degree,
is a centre of pilgrimage. The reverence with which
he is regarded is expressed in the saying current among
Moslems:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>SHARANI, THE EGYPTIAN<br />
<span class="smcap">(ad 1550)</span></h4>

<p>One of the last representatives of the mystical school
of Islam is Sharani, who wrote in the middle of the
sixteenth century. In his time Egypt had just been
conquered by the Turks, whose military despotism took
the place of the feudal anarchy which had prevailed
under the Mameluke sultans. The supremacy of Islam
was not affected by the change, the Turks being
as sincere Moslems as the Arabs. The administration
of the country was centralised in the hands of a Pasha,
who resided at Cairo as governor-general. As elsewhere
in the Muhammadan world, the most powerful class
was that of the Ulema, or learned men. The generous
gifts which the Sultan showered upon them and the
privileged position he allowed them quickly reconciled
them to the new regime. But there was another
numerous body, who, though deprived of the substantial
advantages which the Ulema enjoyed, had, however,
with the masses a prestige almost as great. These were
the Sufis. Poor and humble, they were lost in the crowd,
whence they drew their origin, and whose miseries they
shared. A smouldering animosity existed between
these Essenes of Islam and the Ulema, who corresponded
to the Pharisees. These last claimed to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
exclusive depositaries of religious knowledge and
divine wisdom; they administered justice and monopolised
benefices.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Sufis was in diametrical opposition
to this. In their eyes the knowledge derived from
books and theological science was far inferior to the
inner perception of the supernatural, the mystic intuition
to which they claimed to attain in their religious
ecstacies. They regarded the theosophist as far superior
in every respect to the theologian. Besides this, they
considered the different sects of Islam as equally good,
and attached no importance to any of the formalities
of the ceremonial law, the strict observation of which
was considered by the orthodox as binding on every
good Moslem. Thus, the reading of the Koran, with
rhythmical intonation, as practised in every mosque,
had in their eyes no value. To adore God with a pure
heart, according to them, was infinitely more important
than all outward observances.</p>

<p>Such ideas could not be acceptable to the Ulemas,
who saw the absolute authority in religious matters
slipping from their hands. Only a moderate power
of perception was needed to understand what dangers
for the official hierarchy lurked in the ideas of these
enthusiasts who claimed to derive divine wisdom from
a source so different to that of which the Ulemas believed
themselves to be the sole dispensers.</p>

<p>It is true that Arab mysticism had never taken such
a bold flight as Persian theosophy, which proclaimed
openly a Pantheistic system, in which the authority
of the books revealed to different prophets was displaced
by a poetic belief. According to this faith, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
universe was an emanation of God, the human soul
a spark of the Divine Essence gone astray in this transitory
world, but destined to return finally to God, after
having been purified of its earthly stains. The Arab
Sufis did not go so far; for them the Koran was always
the Word of God, and Muhammed was His prophet.
They conformed externally to the precepts of Islam, but
claimed at the same time to understand God and His
law better than the theologians, and that not by the
study of large volumes of exegesis and traditions,
but by celestial inspiration. The orthodox mullahs
understood the danger, and did not conceal their
growing irritation against these audacious heretics.
The government and the great majority of Moslems
were on the side of the Ulema, but the mystics found
sympathy among the people, and their ideas spread
with incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century, a man of great ability, of
whom the Muhammadans are justly proud, made a
vigorous effort to reconcile orthodox Islam with the
Sufi doctrines current in his time. This man was
Ghazzali. He consecrated the labour of a lifetime to
this task, and his chief work, "The Revival of the
Religious Sciences," is a veritable encyclop&aelig;dia of
Islam. He did not work in vain, but succeeded in
erecting a system in which dogmatic theology is cleverly
combined with the theosophy of the Arab school of
mysticism. But Islam such as Ghazzali conceived it
is no longer that of ancient times. Another order of
ideas has been insensibly substituted for the austere
creed of the Prophet of Mecca, the very foundations
of which they have undermined. Muhammad's re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>ligious
edifice remains standing, its framework and
external outlines are the same; but the spirit which
informs it is profoundly different. Arab mysticism
has succeeded in finding a footing in the official circles
of the Moslem hierarchy.</p>

<p>The reconciliation, however, of the mystics with the
theologians was only apparent, and could not be otherwise.
At the bottom of the question there were two
incompatible principles. For the theologians the letter
of the Koran and written tradition contained all religious
knowledge. For the mystics the dead letter was
nothing, and the inspiration of their own hearts was the
sole source of all knowledge. Of these two principles,
one subordinates reason to tradition and tends to the
almost complete abdication of thought in favour of
absolute faith; the other results in enthroning imagination,
spiritual hallucination and mystic ecstacy.
The first confines religion to too narrow limits; the
second robs it of all palpable substance and positive
form, and makes it as vague and intangible as the
clouds.</p>

<p>Egypt has always been a soil favourable to the development
of mystic tendencies. Christian asceticism
took early root there, and during the first centuries of
our era thousands of anchorites inhabited the deserts
of the Thebaid, and carried on there religious exercises
of extreme austerity. We do not know what secret
connection may exist between the climate of the
valley of the Nile and the character of its inhabitants,
but if the Arab chroniclers deserve any credit,
Arab mysticism originated in this country. The
celebrated theosophist Zu'l Noun is known as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
first who introduced into Islam visions and mystic
ecstacies. Some centuries later the famous poet
Omar Ibn Faridh saw the light at Cairo, and since
then Egypt has produced a long series of Muhammadan
ascetics more or less famous. Sharani is one of the
last of this theosophic school of Egypt, the doctrines
of which he expounds in his numerous works. We
do not know if the impression he made on his contemporaries
was as great as the zeal with which he
pleads the cause of mysticism, but up to the present
day his memory is religiously preserved at Cairo, where
a mosque still bears his name. The natives revere his
memory as that of a saint. He himself informs us
that the publication of his work entitled "Al bahr al
Maurud" gave rise to serious disturbances at Cairo.</p>

<p>In this work Sharani expounds the duties of the true
Sufi, the perfect theosophist, and at the same time in
very energetic language he exposes the defects and
weakness of the Muhammadan society of his day. His
most virulent attacks are naturally directed against
the Ulema, as in the following extract:</p>

<p>"We Sufis have entered into an engagement never
to allow one of our body to have recourse to intrigues
to obtain employment such as those practised by self-styled
doctors of the law. The endeavour to obtain such
a post is all the more contemptible when it has belonged
to a person recently deceased who has left sons or brothers
or when it is already occupied by a poor man who has
no protector or support in the world. Such acts of
injustice, however, are often committed by the so-called
Ulema. The plot to supplant men of merit, with
the aim of obtaining for themselves lucrative posts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
which they straightway dispose of for money to incompetent
individuals.</p>

<p>"Often one man occupies more than one office,
<i>e.g.</i>, that of preacher in mosques so far apart that it is
impossible for him to attend to both properly; in
which case he puts in a deputy-preacher (sometimes
he does not even do that) and pays him part of the
emolument of the post, pocketing the rest.</p>

<p>"We have also entered into an engagement to rise
before our superiors when they appear, and to kiss
their hands even when they are unjust. We do this
with the Ulema, although they do not act in a manner
conformable to the science which they profess."</p>

<p>In speaking of the Christians and the Jews, he praises
their demeanour, in order to censure all the more sharply
the pretensions of the Ulema. "See," he says, "how
modestly they conduct themselves towards the meanest
subordinates, and you will see that their manners and
demeanour are more noble and worthy of imitation
than those of the Ulema. They are not angry if people
do not make room for them when they enter a public
assembly; and if they are offered to drink water
which has been sullied by the hands of children, slaves
or beggars, they do not change countenance, but on
the contrary consider themselves as the last of men.
When they are allowed to sit down in an assembly
they look upon it as a favour. They take their places
with heads bent, praying God to cover their faults with
the veil of his clemency, and not to expose them to the
scorn of others. These are the distinctive qualities of
the truly learned; for if learning does not increase
the modesty of him who has it, it is good for nothing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>These extracts make it sufficiently plain with what
courage the daring theosophist censured the most
influential class of Moslem society in his day. Sharani
reproaches the Ulema, with their ambition, their
cupidity, their pride, their hypocrisy, and he advises
them to confine themselves in their sermons simply to
dwelling on the precepts of the moral law and to abstain
from speaking of the recompenses and punishments of
the future life, since the destiny of souls after death depends
on God, and not on them.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of these ideas, Sharani
goes on to inveigh against the Turkish Government,
which, wishing to create for itself a support in the
powerful class of the Ulema, made them great concessions,
and by doing so annoyed their antagonists the Sufis.
Thus Sharani does not hesitate to say that since
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1517 real learning had ceased to exist, that being
the date of the conquest of Egypt by the Sultan Selim.</p>

<p>The lot of the Egyptian fellahin or peasants has never
been an enviable one. Successive Roman and Arab
dominations brought no change favourable to them.
Under the Mamelukes, when the country was parcelled
out among petty feudal lords ruling over their domains
with absolute authority, the condition of the peasants
was one of extreme wretchedness. Sharani finds that
in his time the state of the agricultural class was worse
than formerly.</p>

<p>"In past times," he says, "when a peasant died,
there was often found in the corner of his house a
jar, a pot or other vessel filled with pieces of gold. It
was what the poor man had saved from his harvests
after having paid his taxes and the daily expenses of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
his family and his guests. But in our day, in order
to pay his taxes, the peasant is often obliged to sell
the produce of his land, the ox with which he ploughs,
and the cow which gives him milk.</p>

<p>"If part of his tax is unpaid he is taken to prison,
and often his wife and children accompany him thither.
Often the Kashif or governor disposes of the hand of
his daughter without consulting him, and her dowry is
kept back to pay the arrears of his tax. It sometimes
happens that the tax charged upon him is not really
due from him at all, but from his fellow-villagers who
have gone away to avoid molestation."</p>

<p>Elsewhere he says, "We Sufis have entered into an
engagement not to buy merchandises, gardens or
water-wheels, for in our time the taxes on these are
so heavy that no one can afford to possess them. Let
him who listens not to our counsel and acquires such
property, blame himself if he has to undergo all kinds of
humiliations; if, in order that the Government may
pay for naval expeditions, it demands of him in advance
a year's taxes on his houses, his merchandise or his
lands. Then he will say with a sigh, 'How happy are
they who possess nothing.'"</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see in these passages a profound
dissatisfaction, not only with the ruling class, but with
the Government itself. Notwithstanding this, Sharani
enjoins his disciples to respect the temporal authority
and to submit to the laws. Passive obedience has
always characterised the Oriental.</p>

<p>We do not know precisely whether Sharani had in
view a veritable reform of Muhammadan society.
Probably the contrary. He felt deeply the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
uneasiness of the time; he understood that Islam was
entering a period of decadence, but he had, as far as
we can see, no clear plan for its regeneration. Mysticism,
in which he was such a fervent adept, here hindered him.
But this mystical tendency, which was in one respect
his weakness, was his glory in another. A tone of high
moral purity marks his utterances on the social and
religious state of his time, and, led rather by instinct
than by philosophical considerations, he hits the blot
on Muhammadan society&mdash;polygamy. We may judge
by the following extract: "We Sufis have entered into
an engagement to espouse only one wife, and not to
associate others with her.</p>

<p>"The man who has only one wife is happy; his
means are sufficient to support his home; but as soon
as he takes a second wife, the prosperity of his house
decreases, and when he opens his money-box he finds
it empty. A pure-hearted wife is a great happiness
in the house. Oh, how often while I was weaving<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
have I stolen a glance at my wife, the mother of my son
Abdurrahman, sewing garments for the poor. I understood
then that I had happiness in my house. Often
she opened her larder which sufficed us for whole
months, and distributed the contents to the poor,
who quickly emptied it. May God be merciful to her."</p>

<p>As a religious reformer, Sharani endeavoured to
restore Islam to its primitive unity. Many sects
existed in it from the earliest times<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> four of which preserved
the title of orthodox. Sharani sought to unite
these sects on a common basis, and numerous passages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>in his writings attest that this idea remained with him
all his life. His efforts apparently had no success,
but for those who have faith in the power of ideas, it is
certain that Sharani has not lived nor laboured in vain.
In the East, reforming ideas do not make way so
quickly as in Europe, but their effect is none the less
great when they come to the front. Few details of
Sharani's life are known. He informs us that he belonged
to the order of the Shadiliyah dervishes, and
that his instructor in mysticism was the Egyptian
Sufi, Ali Khawass. He died at Cairo, <span class="smcap">a.d. 1565.</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">59</span></a> Sharani was a weaver by trade.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h4>MULLAH SHAH<br />
<span class="smcap">(d 1661)</span></h4>


<p>Mullah Shah was born <span class="smcap">a.d. 1584</span>, in the village of
Erkesa in Badakshan, a mountainous and inaccessible
country to the north of the Indian Caucasus. His
family, which was of Mongol origin, held a certain
position, and his grandfather had been judge of the
village. At the age of twenty-one the young man
quitted his relatives and his country, and went back
to Balkh, then a centre of learning in Central Asia. He
made great progress there, especially in the knowledge
of Arabic. After some time he left Balkh, and turning
his steps southward, arrived at Kashmir, where he
continued his studies, but an irresistible thirst after
truth made him feel the necessity of seeking a spiritual
guide, and he resolved to go to Lahore, where there
lived a celebrated saint, Sheikh Mian Mir.</p>

<p>The reception he met with was not favourable.
Mian Mir at first repulsed him, but allowed himself
at last to be overcome by the perseverance of the young
man, and taught him Sufi exercises according to the
rule of the Qadiri order of dervishes.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The stifling
heat of Lahore did not suit the health of Mullah Shah,
who accordingly resolved to spend the summers in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>Kashmir, returning to Lahore for the winter. He led
this life for several years, till he had passed through all
the stages of asceticism, but his spiritual guide would
not lead him to the supreme goal of mystical science,
which is termed "Union with God," or "knowledge of
oneself."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Mian Mir only spoke to him of it in an enigmatic way
and said, "Do not cease to study thyself and thine own
heart, for thy goal is in thyself."</p>

<p>In the year 1636 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he returned again, as usual,
from Lahore to Kashmir, and practised his austerities
without relaxation, when one day, by the special favour
of the Divinity, and without the assistance of any
spiritual preceptor, "the desired image" revealed itself
to him. By this expression is understood, in mystic
phraseology, union with God, and the conception of
Absolute Being, which is equivalent to the knowledge
of one's self. When Mullah Shah thus attained the
goal of his mystical aspirations he was in his forty-seventh
year, and had been engaged twenty-seven years in the
spiritual exercises of the Sufis. When he returned to
Lahore, he informed his spiritual guide that he had
attained union with God. The latter advised him not
to divulge the fact, and not to give up his ascetic practices.
In Kashmir Mullah Shah had collected round him
a little circle of devoted disciples. The strong emotional
condition into which Mullah Shah's new spiritual
experience had brought him did not prevent him from
doing his best not to offend against the religious law,
and he was in the habit of saying to his friends, "Whoso
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>does not respect the precepts of the religious law is
not one of us."</p>

<p>Mullah Shah had always been of a retiring disposition,
but in his present mood he carried his self-isolation
so far that he closed the door of his house and only
received his intimates at fixed times, when he dropped
his habitual reserve. The spiritual power of Mullah
Shah had become so great that every novice whom he
caused to sit in front of him and to concentrate his
mental faculties on his own heart, became clairvoyant
to such a degree that his internal senses were unfolded,
and the unseen world appeared to him.</p>

<p>Mullah Shah expressed himself in very bold terms
regarding the manner with which he conceived God
and His relation to humanity. Thus he said, "Since
I have arrived at understanding the absolute Reality
and that I know most positively that nothing exists
besides God, existence and non-existence are in my
eyes the same thing." In one of his poems he says,
"The sage who knows himself has become God, be
sure of that, my friend." In another poem, which
caused a temporary estrangement between himself and
the Sheikh Mian Mir, he said:</p>

<p>"My heart by a thousand tongues cries to me 'I
am God.' What reproach of heresy can they bring
against me that this utterance comes to my lips?</p>

<p>"Those who had attained union with God used to
say, 'I am Absolute Being.'</p>

<p>"But I only say what I have heard from the mouth
of Sheikh Mian Mir."</p>

<p>In the meantime the number of his adherents daily
increased; persons of all classes in society became his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
adherents; even women became capable of mystical
intuitions by the effect of his prayers and without having
seen him. However, the increasing number of those
who wished to approach him commenced to be inconvenient,
and he said, "I am not a sheikh of dervishes
who receives novices and builds convents."</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Neither the mosque nor the dervish-convent attract me,</span>
<span class="i0">But the purity of the desert and the freedom of the open country."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the year 1634 <span class="smcap">a.d</span>., a certain Mir Baki, a descendant
of the prophet, attached himself to Mullah Shah, and
experienced in a short time ecstatic states; he then
preached the doctrine of union with God without any
reserve. At the same time he claimed to be free from
the precepts of the religious law. The following lines
were composed by him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why should my hand let go this sparkling cup of my soul,</span>
<span class="i0">I already realise the aspirations of to-morrow."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which lines, rendered into prose, seem to mean, "Why
should I pass my life sadly on in self-maceration and
austerity? I prefer to anticipate now the delights
which they speak of as belonging to the future life."
This is epicureanism, pure and simple, such as we find
it in the odes of Hafiz and the Quatrains of Omar
Khayyam. When Mullah Shah heard of these extravagant
utterances, he caused Mir Baki to be expelled
from the town. At the same time the doctrines of
Mullah Shah regarding union with God began to make
a great deal of sensation, and a large number of influential
men who belonged to the Conservative party
raised against him the accusation of heresy without
really understanding his teaching. They quoted some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of his verses against him, and said, "Mullah Shah is
beginning to imitate Mansur Hellaj.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> He should be
brought to trial and sentenced to death." They
unanimously drew up an indictment against him and
affixed their seals; a large number of religious functionaries
joined them, and they submitted their petition
to the Emperor Shah-jehan, requesting him to pronounce
sentence of death against Mullah Shah. The
Emperor consented, and despatched a firman to that
effect to Zafer-Khan, governor of Kashmir. Shah-jehan's
son, the prince Dara-Shikoh, had been absent,
and only learned what had happened when he returned.
He immediately went to his father and represented to
him that Mullah Shah was a pupil of Sheikh Mian Mir,
a man renowned for piety, and that the Emperor ought,
before pronouncing final judgment, to ask the latter
regarding the conduct of his former disciple. The prince
concluded by saying that in such a matter haste was
ill-omened, because to deprive a man of life is to pull
down a building of which God is the Architect. The
Emperor accepted this appeal graciously, and ordered
the execution to be deferred. Meanwhile the news of
the condemnation of Mullah Shah had spread and
reached Kashmir, but the respite obtained by the Prince
was still unknown there. The friends of Mullah Shah
were in despair, and used their utmost endeavours to
persuade him to fly. But he answered, "I am not an
impostor that I should seek safety in flight; I am an
utterer of truth; death and life are to me alike. Let
my blood in another life also redden the impaling stake.
I am living and eternal; death recoils from me, for my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>knowledge has vanquished death. The sphere where all
colours are effaced has become my abode."</p>

<p>"Once," he added, "I used to bar the door of my
house with a bolt in order not to be disturbed by anyone,
but now I will leave it wide open, in order that
whoever wishes to make me a martyr may enter at his
pleasure."</p>

<p>Mullah Shah thus awaited death in an attitude of
imperturbable calm, but fate had decided otherwise.
Not long afterwards the Emperor Shah-jehan went
to Lahore, and in the company of Prince Dara-Shikoh
paid a visit to the Sheikh Mian Mir, and questioned him
concerning Mullah Shah. Mian Mir told him that
Mullah Shah was apt to be carried out of himself when in
an ecstatic state, and that then he sometimes spoke
without observing the reserve necessary on the doctrine
of union with God; but he adjured the Emperor at the
same time to take no steps against his old pupil, "For,"
he said, "this holy man is a consuming fire, and woe
to you if he be irritated, for he could destroy the world.
In any case prevent the orthodox party from persecuting
him, otherwise some dreadful disaster may
happen."</p>

<p>This advice made a deep impression on the Emperor,
who thanked Prince Dara-Shikoh for having prevented
his carrying out the sentence of death. He said,
"These theologians have tried to persuade me to kill
a visionary dervish; I thank thee, my son, for having
prevented my committing an act of injustice." Some
time afterwards the Emperor went to Kashmir, but he
did not see Mullah Shah, who had become so fond of
solitude that he rarely showed himself in the city.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>In 1635 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Sheikh Mian Mir died at Lahore,
and in the same year one of the chief nobles of the
court named Najat Khan became a disciple of Mullah
Shah. About the same time, Mozaffer Beg, one of the
Emperor's suite, devoted himself to his service, and his
example was followed by several of his friends. But
no sooner had they been initiated into the mystical
doctrines than they believed themselves privileged to
dispense with the prescribed fast of Ramazan and the
obligatory prayers, considering that the religious law
no longer applied to them. Being informed of these
irregularities, Mullah Shah prayed the governor to
have them removed from the town.</p>

<p>About this time he made a collection of his verses,
among which are the following:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If alchemy can change dust into gold, thou marvellest;</span>
<span class="i0">But asceticism is an alchemy which changes dust into God.</span>
<span class="i0">If a man dives into the ocean of Deity what does he become?</span>
<span class="i0">As a drop which falls from the clouds into the sea."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Regarding pedantic theologians, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Well I know these preachers who do not practise,</span>
<span class="i0">Their memory stored with a hundred thousand traditions,</span>
<span class="i0">While their mind is empty of ideas."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1639 the Emperor Shah-jehan came a second time
to Kashmir, and took up his dwelling in the park
called Zafer-abad, in a pavilion which commanded a
delightful view of the lake. No sooner had he arrived
than he sent for Mullah Shah, who came without
delay. The Emperor received him with marked kindness
and conversed long with him on subjects relating to
the Sufi sciences.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
This same year is remarkable for an event which
had important results for Mullah Shah and his followers.
The Prince Dara-Shikoh, who had saved Mullah Shah's
life by his intervention, had always been marked by
keen religious feeling, and often spent whole nights in
prayer and meditation. He had often heard of the
extraordinary powers of Mullah Shah, but had never
had the opportunity of seeing him, as the sheikh still
maintained his habits of retirement. Little by little,
a feeling of irresistible curiosity took possession of the
Prince; he determined to see the holy man who was
so highly spoken of, and one night, accompanied by a
single servant named Mujahid, he left his palace and
directed his steps towards the dwelling of Mullah
Shah. The latter had in his courtyard an ancient
plane-tree, and was in the habit of sitting at the foot
of it during the night, lost in meditation. Having
arrived at the house, the prince ordered his servant
to wait near the door, and entered the courtyard alone.
Seeing the Sheikh seated at the foot of the tree, he
stopped and remained standing till the master should
speak to him. The latter knew very well who the
new-comer was, and that little persuasion was needed
to make him one of his disciples; but he made as though
he did not see him. A long time passed thus, till the
Sheikh broke the silence by asking the Prince "Who
art thou?" The Prince did not speak. Mullah Shah
then said again, "Why dost thou not answer? Speak,
and tell thy name."</p>

<p>The Prince, filled with embarrassment, replied, "My
name is Dara-Shikoh." "Who is thy father?"
"The Emperor Shah-jehan," "Why hast thou come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
to see me?" "Because I feel drawn towards God,
and seek for a spiritual guide." On this Mullah Shah
exclaimed sharply, "What are emperors and princes
to me? Know that I am a man devoted to asceticism.
Is this hour of the night the time to come and trouble
me? Go, and do not show thyself here a second time."</p>

<p>Deeply wounded by this reception, the Prince withdrew
and re-entered his palace, where he spent the whole
night weeping. But in spite of all his disappointment,
he felt himself drawn the next night by an irresistible
attraction towards the saint's dwelling, but the latter
this time did not even condescend to speak to him.
Mujahid, the servant who accompanied the Prince,
became angry, and said to his master, "What miracles
has this crabbed dervish shown you that you should
come here every night and expose yourself to such
indignities? Ordinary dervishes are cheerful folk,
not uncivil and morose like this old man. For my own
part, I set no great store by this asceticism, and the
only thing that makes me uneasy is your putting faith
in it." The Prince answered, "If Mullah Shah was an
impostor, so far from treating me as he has done,
he would, on the contrary, have prayed God to bring
me to him. It is precisely his independent spirit and
irritated manner which proves him to be an extraordinary
man." That same night when Mujahid
returned home, he was seized by fever and carried off
in a few hours. Dara-Shikoh, when informed of this
terrible event, was profoundly moved. He reproached
himself bitterly for not having at once punished his
servant's insolence, and considered the death of Mujahid
as a divine punishment which menaced him also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
He immediately sent for the Qazi Afzal, one of his most
devoted friends, and told him of his anxiety. The
latter was a friend of Akhund Mullah Muhammad Synd,
a disciple of Mullah Shah, and at his instance the Sheikh
consented to see the prince.</p>

<p>Dara-Shikoh could not pay his visit during the day,
from fear of arousing public curiosity, but as soon as
night fell, he presented himself before the Sheikh,
whom this time he found seated in his cell. Before
crossing the threshold, the Prince saluted the holy man
with profound respect, and the latter bade him enter
and be seated. The cell was lighted by a single lamp,
whose wick was smoking; in his eager desire to discern
the venerable features of the Sheikh, the Prince dressed
the wick with his own fingers. This simple action gained
him the Sheikh's affection. At the end of some days
he bade him to blindfold himself, then he concentrated
his attention upon him in such a way that the invisible
world was revealed to the view of the Prince, who
felt his heart filled with joy.</p>

<p>Dara-Shikoh had a sister, the Princess Fatimah,
to whom he was deeply attached. As soon as he had
become a disciple of Mullah Shah and his heart had
been opened to the intuition of the spiritual world,
he hastened to inform his sister. This news made
such an impression on the mind of the Princess that
she wrote to the Sheikh several letters full of humility
and devotion. He read them all, but made no reply
for more than a month, till he was convinced that
Fatimah was animated by an invincible resolution.
At last he accorded his sympathy to her also, and admitted
her to the circle of the initiates. The Princess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
persevered ardently in these mystical studies, and received
the instructions of her spiritual guide by correspondence.
She attained to such perfection that she
arrived at intuitive knowledge of God and union with
Him. Although the Sheikh was full of affection for
all his disciples, he had a particular regard for her, and
was in the habit of saying that "she had attained to
such an extraordinary degree of knowledge that she
was fit to be his successor."</p>

<p>Mullah Shah was now old and infirm; he had passed
several winters at Lahore, surrounded by the care and
attention of his friends and pupils. In the year 1655
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Emperor wrote to him to invite him to pass
the winter with him at Shahjahanabad, his ordinary
residence, but the Sheikh was beginning to suffer from
weakness of the eyes, and did not feel strong enough
to undertake the journey. For some years he remained
in Kashmir, and would often say, "The theosophist
ought to profit by length of life. My life is approaching
its end; let us then enjoy our stay in Kashmir, and not
leave it."</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1658 Aurangzeb, Dara-Shikoh's younger
brother, seized on the person of his father the Emperor
Shah-jehan, whom he kept in confinement for the
rest of his life, and had Dara assassinated in prison.
Aurangzeb was a bigoted Muhammadan, and his
accession to the throne threatened to have serious consequences
for Mullah Shah. As soon as he had assumed
the reins of government, the clerical party began to
represent to him that Mullah Shah taught doctrines
contrary to revealed religion. There were not wanting
witnesses on the other side, but the Emperor, on hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the complaints against Mullah Shah, sent an order to
the governor of Kashmir to send him to the capital.
The governor pleaded for a delay on account of Mullah
Shah's advanced age and weakness till he was strong
enough to make the journey. A year thus passed by;
some verses which Mullah Shah composed in honour
of Aurangzeb made a favourable impression on the
Emperor, and the Princess Fatimah having interceded
on behalf of her old teacher, Aurangzeb revoked his
first order, and merely enjoined him to take up his
residence at Lahore as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It was not till 1660 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> that Mullah Shah could obey
this order; he left Kashmir at the beginning of winter
and came to Lahore, where he continued to live a retired
life, only granting interviews to a few chosen
disciples. But when from time to time he had an access
of mystical emotion he would speak of union with God
without any reserve, in a loud voice, and without
noticing who was present. One of his friends said to
him one day, "We live in a strange time, and people
are disquieted by your discourses on this matter; it
would be more prudent to expound your doctrines
with a little more reserve." The Sheikh answered him,
"Up to the present I have never been afraid for my
life; books containing such doctrine are known to all,
and everyone has read them. What precautions, then,
at my time of life, ought I to observe? I cannot
abandon or change my habits of thinking and speaking
now."</p>

<p>Some of his other sayings reported at this time show
that he had already a presentiment of his approaching
death. Kabil Khan, one of his friends, said to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
one day, "Formerly our sovereign Aurangzeb loved to
listen to discourses on the subject of mysticism, and
I have often had the honour of reading before him
passages from the Masnavi of Jalaluddin Rumi.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
The Emperor was often so touched by them that he
shed tears; certainly when he comes to Lahore he
will wish to see you." "No," replied Mullah Shah;
"we shall never see him:</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The night is great with child, see what it will bring forth.'"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1661 he had an attack of fever which lasted about
fifteen days. That year fever became epidemic at
Lahore, and on the 11th of the month of Safar Mullah
Shah had another attack, which carried him off on the
night of the 15th of the same month. He was buried in
a plot of ground which he had already acquired for the
purpose. The Princess Fatimah bought the surrounding
land, and erected a shrine of red stone over his tomb.
The foregoing sketch of Mullah Shah gives a general
view of oriental spiritualism as it prevailed two and
a half centuries ago over a great part of Asia. The
first point worthy of notice in it is the immense popularity
of mystical ideas at that time, and the wide influence
which they exercised over all minds. Round Mullah
Shah gathered persons of every condition; poor peasants
as well as princes were seized with the same enthusiasm
for his doctrines; the same ascetic training produced
the same results in the most varying temperaments.
The Master seems to have exercised a kind of magnetic
influence over his neophytes. He fixes his gaze upon
them for a longer or shorter time, till their inward senses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>open and render them capable of seeing the wonders of
the spiritual world. All the accounts are unanimous
in this respect, and they carry such a stamp of sincerity
that their veracity is indisputable. We are then obliged
to admit that at this period many minds shared a predisposition
to religious ecstacy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Under the apparent stagnation of the East, there is
continually going on a collision between two opposing
forces&mdash;the official hierarchy of the Ulema, conservative
to the core, and mysticism in its early phases, pietistic
and enthusiastic, but gradually tending to scepticism,
and finally to pantheism and the negation of all positive
religion. The Mussalman hierarchy, which in its
own interests desired to maintain the prestige of dogma
and of the revealed law, combatted this tendency to
mysticism, but, as we have seen, without success. The
orthodox mullahs made fruitless efforts to obtain the
condemnation of Mullah Shah, who had on his side the
members of the imperial family of Delhi and the Emperor
himself, all more or less imbued with mystical
ideas.</p>

<p>The biography of Mullah Shah also throws a great
deal of light on the fundamental ideas of oriental
mysticism. They spring from a pantheistic philosophy
in many respects, startlingly resembling those of modern
times. Mullah Shah often insists that individual existence
counts for nothing, and that nothing in reality
exists outside of God, the Absolute Being; every
particular life dissolves in this universal unity, life
and death are mere changes in the form of existence.
The individual is only in some way a part of the Infinite
Being who fills the universe; a particle which has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
momentarily detached therefrom, only to return thither.
To know oneself is therefore the equivalent of knowing
God. But in order to acquire this knowledge the pupil
must submit to long and painful self-discipline; he
must pass through all the tests of the severest asceticism;
only after he has thus prepared himself will the spiritual
master open his heart and render him capable of perceiving
the mysteries of the spiritual world.</p>

<p>But this great secret must not be divulged; it is
only permissable to speak of it to the initiate, as Mullah
Shah says, in the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We must say that only One exists,</span>
<span class="i0">Though such a saying excite astonishment;</span>
<span class="i0">The universe is He, though we must not say so openly,</span>
<span class="i0">Such doctrines must be kept secret.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This Eastern Pantheism does not lack a certain
grandeur, but it has also a dangerous side, and tends
to atheism and materialism. Of this some instances
occur in the life of Mullah Shah. The passage from
pantheism to epicureanism is not a long one. If the
human soul only possesses a transient individuality,
and after death is merged like a drop in the ocean of
divinity, why, many will argue, not have done with
asceticism for good, and enjoy the pleasures of existence
as long as possible during the little while our individuality
endures? Thus Omar Khayyam says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,</span>
<span class="i0">Before we too into the dust descend,</span>
<span class="i0">Dust into dust, and under dust to lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Sans wine, sans song, sans singer, and&mdash;sans end.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is precisely this dangerous side of oriental philosophy
which has unhappily attained a much greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
development and an incomparably more complete
success than the elevated moral systems of the chief
theosophists of Persia. A mocking cynicism has been,
up to modern times, a common characteristic of the
great majority of Sufis and dervishes. The dangerous
consequences of theosophical ideas and of oriental
spiritualism in general became at an early date so
apparent that Ghazzali, although a fervent partisan
of Sufism, did not hesitate to avow that if these doctrines
were generally accepted society would necessarily fall
into a state of anarchy.</p>

<p>In face of the wild aberrations caused by Sufism,
we should not grudge all the greater credit to the few
distinguished men who, although adherents of Sufism
and dominated by its doctrines, kept their characters
clear of stain. In spite of their conviction that there
was no individual life after death, these men spent their
lives in mortification of the senses and in abstinence, and
often braved death with a truly Roman stoicism.</p>

<p>Such shining characters are not of frequent occurrence
in oriental history; but certainly Mullah Shah is one
and Prince Dara-Shikoh another. In a path strewn
with pitfalls he kept a name without stain and without
reproach, thanks to the austere moral principles instilled
into him by his master. He faced death with
calm resignation, and knew how to die as a prince and
as a philosopher.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;Prince Dara-Shikoh has left a curious fragment of
spiritual autobiography in his preface to a Persian translation
of the Upanishads or chapters from the Vedas which he had
caused to be translated from Sanskrit. It is indeed strange
to see this son of a Muhammadan Emperor ranking these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>selections from the Vedas above the Koran, the Pentateuch,
Psalms and Gospels, all of which he says he had read. The
Preface runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Dara-Shikoh, the resigned worshipper of God, visited
Kashmir in the year of the Hegira 1050 (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1640), by the
blessing of the Most High he met with Mullah Shah, the chief
of the learned, the teacher of teachers, versed in the subtleties
of "Tauhid" (Unity); may he be joined with God!</p>

<p>"As that prince already relished the pleasure of seeing the
learning of each sect, had perused various treaties of the Sufi
philosophers, and even composed some himself, the thirst of
exploring the doctrine of the Unity (which is a boundless ocean)
daily increased, and his mind attained a degree of acuteness
and subtlety which would have been impossible without the immediate
assistance and favour of the Divine will. Now the
sacred Koran, being frequently obscure, and few at this day
being found capable of explaining it, he determined to read
all inspired works; that the word of God might furnish a
commentary on itself, and what is concisely expressed in one
book might be elucidated by a reference to others;
the abridged being the more diffuse. With this view he perused
the Pentateuch, the Gospels and the Psalms, but the unity of
God was obscurely and enigmatically expressed in these works;
nor did he derive more instruction from the simple translations
of hired linguists.</p>

<p>"He next desired to ascertain how it happened that in Hindustan
the Unity of God is the frequent theme of discourse, and
that the ancient philosophers of India neither denied nor objected
to the doctrine of the Divine Unity, but on the contrary held
it as an axiom. Unlike the ignorant race of the present day
who set up for philosophers, though they have fallen into the
track of bloodshed and infidelity, denying the attributes and
unity of God, and contradicting the proofs of that doctrine
derived from the Koran and authentic traditions; these may
be considered as banditti on the path of God.</p>

<p>"In the cause of this inquiry it was discovered that amongst
the Hindus, four inspired books were held peculiarly sacred,
viz.: the Rig Veda, the Jajur Veda, the Sam Veda and Atharva
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>Veda, which had descended from the skies to the prophets
of those times, of whom Adam (purified by God; may blessings
attend him!) was the chief, containing rules and precepts; and
this doctrine (viz.: the Unity of God) is clearly expressed in
those books. As the object of this explorer of truth (Dara-Shikoh)
was not the acquisition of languages, whether Arabic,
Syriac or Sanskrit, but the proofs of the Unity of the Supreme
Being, he determined that the Upanishads (which might be
considered as a treasure of Unitarianism) should be translated
into Persian without adding or expunging, and without bias
or partiality, but correctly and literally that it might appear
what mysteries are contained in those books which the Hindus
so carefully conceal from Moslems.</p>

<p>"As the city of Benares, which is the seat of Hindu science,
was a dependency of this explorer of truth (Dara-Shikoh),
having assembled the Pundits and Sanyasis who are the expounders
of the Vedas and Upanishads, he caused a translation
to be made of the latter into Persian. This was completed in
the year of the Hegira, 1067, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, 1656. Every difficulty was
elucidated by this ancient compilation, which, without doubt,
is the first of inspired works, the fountain of truth, the Sea of the
Unity; not only consentaneous with the Koran, but a commentary
on it."</p></div>

<h3>APPENDIX I</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">MOHAMMEDAN CONVERSIONS</span></h4>


<p>By Mohammedan Conversion is not here meant
conversion from Christianity to Mohammedanism,
or <i>vice versa</i>, but those spiritual crises which take
place <i>within</i> Mohammedanism, as within Christianity,
by which the soul is stung as with a regenerating shudder
to use George Eliot's phrase, to rise from a notional
to a real belief in God. Mohammedan theologians
are as aware of this distinction as Christian ones. Thus
Al Ghazzali, in his <i>Revival of the Religious Sciences</i>,
is very sarcastic on the indulgence in the common
expletive, "We take refuge in God," by Mohammedans
without attaching any real meaning to it. He says:
"If you see a lion coming towards you, and there is
a fort close by, you do not stand exclaiming, 'I take
refuge in this fort!' but you get into it. Similarly,
when you hear of the wrath to come, do not merely <i>say</i>,
'I take refuge in God,' but take refuge in Him."</p>

<p>This transformation of a notional into a real belief
has proved the crisis in the lives of many of the saints
and mystics of Islam, without, as far as it appears, any
contact on their part with Christianity. Thus, Ibn
Khalliqan, in his great Biographical Dictionary, tells
of Al-Fudail, a celebrated highwayman, who, one night,
while he was on his way to an immoral assignation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
was arrested by the voice of a Koran-reader chanting
the verse, "Is not the time yet come unto those who
believe, that their hearts should humbly submit to the
admonition of God?" On this he exclaimed, "O Lord!
that time is come." He then went away from that
place, and the approach of night induced him to repair
for shelter to a ruined edifice. He there found a band
of travellers, one of whom said to the others, "Let us
set out"; but another answered, "Let us rather wait
till daylight, for Al-Fudail is on the road, and will stop
us." Al-Fudail then turned his heart to God, and
assured them that they had nothing to fear. For the
rest of his life he lived as an ascetic, and ranked among
the greatest saints. One of his recorded sayings is,
"If the world with all it contains were offered to me,
even on the condition of my not being taken to account
for it, I would shun it as you would shun a carrion,
lest it should defile your clothes."</p>

<p>Another striking "conversion" is that of Ibrahim
Ben Adham, Prince of Khorassan. He was passionately
addicted to the chase, and one day when so employed
heard a voice behind him exclaiming, "O Ibrahim,
thou wast not born for this." At first he took it for
a delusion of Satan, but on hearing the same words
pronounced more loudly exclaimed, "It is the Lord
who speaks; His servant will obey." Immediately
he desisted from his amusement, and, changing clothes
with an attendant, bade adieu to Khorassan, took the
road towards Syria, and from thenceforth devoted
himself entirely to a life of piety and labour.</p>

<p>A third example is that of Ghazzali himself, who, in
his work <i>The Deliverance from Error</i>, has left one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
very few specimens of Eastern religious autobiography,
and one bearing a certain resemblance to Newman's
<i>Apologia</i>. He was professor of theology at the University
of Bagdad in the eleventh century. In his
autobiography he says: "Reflecting upon my situation,
I found myself bound to this world by a thousand ties;
temptations assailed me on all sides. I then examined
my actions. The best were those relating to instruction
and education; and even there I saw myself given up
to unimportant sciences, all useless in another world.
Reflecting on the aim of my teaching, I found it was
not pure in the sight of the Lord. I saw that all my
efforts were directed towards the acquisition of glory
to myself." After this, as he was one day about to
lecture, his tongue refused utterance; he was dumb.
He looked upon this as a visitation from God, and was
deeply afflicted at it. He became seriously ill, and
the physicians said his recovery was hopeless unless
he could shake off his depression. "Then," he continues,
"feeling my helplessness, I had recourse to
God, as one who has no other recourse in his distress.
He compassionated me as He compassionates the unhappy
who invoke Him. My heart no longer made
any resistance, but willingly renounced the glories and
the pleasures of this world."</p>

<p>We may close this short list with the name of the
Sufi poet, Ferid-eddin-Attar. He was a druggist by
trade, and one day was startled by one of the half-mad
fakirs, who swarm in Oriental cities, pensively gazing at
him while his eyes slowly filled with tears. Ferid-eddin
angrily ordered him to go about his business. "Sir,"
replied the fakir, "that is easily done; for my baggage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
is light. But would it not be wise for you to commence
preparations for your journey?" The words struck
home, Ferid-eddin abandoned his business, and devoted
the rest of his life to meditation and collecting the sayings
of the wise.</p>

<p>These four cases, the highwayman, the prince, the
theologian, the poet, are sufficient to show that the
Recognition (anagnorisis) and Revolution (peripeteia),
to use Aristotle's phrase, which turns life from a
chaotic dream into a well-ordered drama, of which
God is the Protagonist, may receive as signal though
not as frequent illustration in the territory of
Islam as in that of Christianity. They also serve to
illustrate Professor W. James' thesis in his Gifford
Lectures, that "conversion," whether Christian or
extra-Christian, is a psychological fact, and not a
mere emotional illusion.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX II</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A MOHAMMEDAN EXPOSITION OF SUFISM
BY IBN KHALDOUN</span></h4>


<p>Sufism consists essentially in giving up oneself
constantly to devotional exercises, in living solely
for God, in abandoning all the frivolous attractions
of the world, in disregarding the ordinary aims of men&mdash;pleasures,
riches and honours&mdash;and finally in
separating oneself from society for the sake of practising
devotion to God. This way of life was extremely
common among the companions of the Prophet and
the early Moslems. But when in the second century
of Islam and the succeeding centuries the desire for
worldly wealth had spread, and ordinary men allowed
themselves to be drawn into the current of a dissipated
and worldly life, the persons who gave themselves
up to piety were distinguished by the name of "Sufis,"
or aspirants to Sufism.</p>

<p>The most probable derivation is from "suf" (wool),
for, as a rule, Sufis wear woollen garments to distinguish
themselves from the crowd, who love gaudy
attire.</p>

<p>For an intelligent being possessed of a body, thought
is the joint product of the perception of events which
happen from without, and of the emotions to which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
give rise within, and is that quality which distinguishes
man from animals. These emotions proceed one from
another; just as knowledge is born of arguments, joy
and sadness spring from the perception of that which
causes grief or pleasure. Similarly with the disciple
of the spiritual life in the warfare which he wages with
himself, and in his devotional exercises. Every struggle
which he has with his passions produces in him a state
resulting from this struggle. This state is either a
disposition to piety which, strengthening by repetition,
becomes for him a "station" (<i>maqam</i>), or merely an
emotion which he undergoes, such as joy, merriment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The disciple of the spiritual life continues to rise
from one station to another, till he arrives at the knowledge
of the Divine Unity and of God, the necessary
condition for obtaining felicity, conformably to the
saying of the Prophet: "Whosoever dies while
confessing that there is no god but God, shall enter
Paradise."</p>

<p>Progress through these different stages is gradual.
They have as their common foundation obedience and
sincerity of intention; faith precedes and accompanies
them, and from them proceed the emotions and qualities,
the transient and permanent modifications of the soul;
these emotions and qualities go on producing others
in a perpetual progression which finally arrives at the
station of the knowledge of the Unity of God. The
disciple of the spiritual life needs to demand an account
of his soul in all its actions, and to keep an attentive
eye on the most hidden recesses of his heart; for
actions must necessarily produce results, and whatever
evil is in results betokens a corresponding evil in actions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>There are but a few persons who imitate the Sufis
in this practice of self-examination, for negligence and
indifference in this respect are almost universal. Pious
men who have not risen to this class (the mystics) only
aim at fulfilling the works commanded by the law in all
the completeness laid down by the science of jurisprudence.
But the mystics examine scrupulously
the results of these works, the effects and impressions
which they produce upon the soul. For this purpose
they use whatever rays of divine illumination may
have reached them while in a state of ecstacy, with
the object of assuring themselves whether their actions
are exempt or not from some defect. The essence of
their system is this practice of obliging the soul often
to render an account of its actions and of what it
has left undone. It also consists in the development
of those gifts of discrimination and ecstacy which
are born out of struggles with natural inclinations,
and which then become for the disciple stations of
progress.</p>

<p>The Sufis possess some rules of conduct peculiar
to themselves, and make use of certain technical expressions.
Of these Ghazzali has treated in <i>Ihya-ul-ulum</i>
("Revival of the Religious Sciences"). He
speaks of the laws regulating devotion, he explains
the rules and customs of the Sufis and the technical
terms which they use. Thus the system of the Sufis,
which was at first only a special way of carrying on
worship, and the laws of which were only handed on
by example and tradition, was methodised and reduced
to writing, like the exegesis of the Koran, the
Traditions, Jurisprudence, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>This spiritual combat and this habit of meditation
are usually followed by a lifting of the veils of sense,
and by the perception of certain worlds which form
part of the "things of God" (knowledge of which He
has reserved for Himself). The sensual man can have
no perception of such things.</p>

<p>Disentanglement from the things of sense and consequent
perception of invisible things takes place when
the spirit, giving up the uses of exterior senses, only
uses interior ones; in this state the emotions proceeding
from the former grow feebler, while those which proceed
from the spirit grow stronger; the spirit dominates, and
its vigour is renewed.</p>

<p>Now, the practice of meditation contributes materially
to this result. It is the nourishment by which the
spirit grows. Such growth continues till what was
the knowledge of One absent becomes the consciousness
of One present, and the veils of sense being lifted, the
soul enjoys the fullness of the faculties which belong
to it in virtue of its essence, <i>i.e.</i>, perception. On
this plane it becomes capable of receiving divine grace
and knowledge granted by the Deity. Finally its
nature as regards the real knowledge of things as they
are, approaches the loftiest heaven of angelic beings.</p>

<p>This disentanglement from things of sense takes
place oftenest in men who practise the spiritual combat,
and thus they arrive at a perception of the real nature
of things such as is impossible to any beside themselves.
Similarly, they often know of events before they arrive;
and by the power of their prayers and their spiritual
force, they hold sway over inferior beings who are
obliged to obey them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>The greatest of the mystics do not boast of this
disentanglement from things of sense and this rule
over inferior creatures; unless they have received an
order to do so, they reveal nothing of what they have
learnt of the real nature of things. These supernatural
workings are painful, and when they experience them
they ask God for deliverance.</p>

<p>The companions of the Prophet also practised this
spiritual warfare; like the mystics, they were overwhelmed
with these tokens of divine favour such as
the power to walk on the water, to pass through fire
without being burnt, to receive their food in miraculous
ways, but they did not attach great importance to them.
Abu-bekr, Omar, and Ali were distinguished by a
great number of these supernatural gifts, and their
manner of viewing them was followed by the mystics
who succeeded them.</p>

<p>But among the moderns there are men who have set
great store by obtaining this disentanglement from things
of sense, and by speaking of the mysteries discovered
when this veil is removed. To reach this goal they have
had recourse to different methods of asceticism, in
which the intellectual soul is nourished by meditation
to the utmost of its capacity, and enjoys in its fullness
the faculty of perception which constitutes its essence.
According to them, when a man has arrived at this point,
his perception comprehends all existence and the real
nature of things without a veil, from the throne of God
to the smallest drops of rain. Ghazzali describes the
ascetic practices which are necessary to arrive at this
state.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>This condition of disentanglement from the things
of sense is only held to be perfect when it springs from
right dispositions. For there are, as a matter of fact,
persons who profess to live in retirement and to fast
without possessing right dispositions; such are sorcerers,
Christians, and others who practise ascetic exercises.
We may illustrate this by the image of a well-polished
mirror. According as its surface is convex or concave,
the object reflected in it is distorted from its real shape;
if, on the contrary, the mirror has a plane surface, the
object is reflected exactly as it is. Now, what a plane
surface is for the mirror, a right disposition is for the
soul, as regards the impressions it receives from without.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX III</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN MOHAMMEDAN
LITERATURE</span></h4>


<p>The almost miraculous renaissance in Islam which
is now proceeding in Turkey and other Mohammedan
countries reminds one forcibly of Dante's lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">For I have seen</span>
<span class="i0">The thorn frown rudely all the winter long,</span>
<span class="i0">And after bear the rose upon its top.</span>
<span class="i10"><i>Paradiso</i>, xiii. 133.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not perhaps fanciful to conjecture that one
of the hidden causes of this renaissance is the large
quantity of Christian truth which Islam literature
holds, so to speak, in solution. It is a well-known fact
that the Koran has borrowed largely from the Old
Testament and the Apocryphal Gospels, but it is not
so generally known that Mohammedan philosophers,
theologians, and poets betray an acquaintance with
facts and incidents of the Gospels of which the Koran
contains no mention.</p>

<p>Leaving the Koran on one side, in the "Traditions,"
<i>i.e.</i>, sayings of Mohammed handed down by tradition,
we find God represented as saying at the Judgment,
"O ye sons of men, I was hungry and ye gave Me no
food," the whole of the passage in Matt. xxv. being
quoted. This is remarkable, as it strikes directly at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the orthodox Mohammedan conception of God as an
impassible despot. Other sayings attributed to God
which have a Christian ring are, "I was a hidden
Treasure and desired to be known, therefore I created
the world"; "If it were not for Thee, I would not have
made the world" (addressed to Mohammed), evidently
an echo of Col. I. 17, "All things have been created
through Him and unto Him" (R.V.). The writer
has often heard this last saying quoted by Indian
Mohammedans in controversy.</p>

<p>Another traditional saying attributed to Mohammed
is not unlike the doctrine of the Holy Spirit: "Verily
from your Lord come breathings. Be ye prepared for
them." The Second Advent is also referred to in others:
"How will it be with you when God sends Jesus to
judge you?" "There is no Mahdi but Jesus." It
is a well-known fact that a certain gate in Jerusalem
is kept walled up because the Mohammedans believe
that Jesus will pass through it when He returns.</p>

<p>Some traditions have twisted Gospel parables, &amp;c., in
favour of Mohammedanism. Thus in the mention of the
parable of the hired labourers, the first two sets of
labourers are said to mean Jews and Christians, and the
last comers, who receive an equal wage, though grumbled
at by the others, are believed to indicate the
Mohammedans. Other traditions give one of Christ's
sayings a grotesquely literal dress. Thus our Lord is
said to have met a fox, and to have said, "Fox! where
art thou going?" The fox replied, to his home. Upon
which our Lord uttered the verse, "Foxes have holes,"
&amp;c. Once when entering an Afghan village the writer
was met by a Pathan, who asked if the New Testament<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
contained that verse. This shows how even garbled
traditions may predispose the Mohammedan mind for
the study of the Gospels.</p>

<p>Tabari, the historian (d. 923 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), gives an account
of the Last Supper and of Christ washing the disciples'
hands (<i>sic</i>)&mdash;topics entirely ignored by the Koran&mdash;and
quotes the saying of our Lord regarding the smiting
of the Shepherd and the scattering of the sheep.</p>

<p>Sufi literature, representing as it does the mystical
side of Islam, abounds with allusions to Scripture.
Al Ghazzali, the great opponent of Averroes (1058-1111
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in his <i>Ihya-ul-ulum</i> ("Revival of the Religious
Sciences") quotes the saying of Christ regarding the
children playing in the market-place. In his <i>Kimiya-i-Saadat</i>
("Alchemy of Happiness") he writes, "It is
said that Jesus Christ in a vision saw this world in
the form of an old woman, and asked how many husbands
she had lived with. She said they were innumerable.
He asked her if they had died, or had divorced her.
She replied that it was neither, the fact being that
she had killed all." Here we seem to have a confused
echo of the episode of the woman of Samaria. Again
in the same work he says, "It is a saying of Jesus
Christ that the seeker of the world is like a man suffering
from dropsy; the more he drinks water the more he
feels thirsty." In the <i>Ihya-ul-ulum</i>, the verse "Eye
hath not seen," &amp;c., is quoted as if from the Koran,
where it nowhere occurs. Ghazzali was an ardent
student of the Neo-Platonists, and through him the
phrases Aql-i-Kull (&mdash;Logos) and Nafs-i-Kull (&mdash;Pneuma)
passed into Sufi writings (v. Whinfield, Preface to the
<i>Masnavi</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>Saadi (b. 1184 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the famous author of the <i>Gulistan</i>
and <i>Bostan</i>, was for some time kept in captivity by
the Crusaders. This may account for echoes of the
Gospels which we find in his writings. In the <i>Gulistan</i>
he quotes the verse, "We are members of one another,"
and in the <i>Bostan</i> the parable of the Pharisee and Publican
is told in great detail.</p>

<p>Nizami (b. 1140) gives a story which, though grotesque,
seems to show that he had apprehended something
of the Christian spirit. Some passers-by were commenting
on the body of a dead dog, saying how abominably
it smelt, &amp;c. Christ passed, and said, "Behold,
how white its teeth are!"</p>

<p>But of all the Mohammedan writers, none bears such
distinct traces of Christian influence as Jalaluddin
Rumi, the greatest of the Sufi poets, who is to this day
much studied in Persia, Turkey and India. In the first
book of his <i>Masnavi</i> he has a strange story of a vizier
who persuaded his king, a Jewish persecutor of the
Christians, to mutilate him. He then went to the
Christians and said, "See what I have suffered for your
religion." After gaining their confidence and being
chosen their guide, he wrote epistles in different directions
to the chief Christians, contradicting each other,
maintaining in one that man is saved by grace, and in
another that salvation rests upon works, &amp;c. Thus
he brought their religion into inextricable confusion.
This is evidently aimed at St. Paul, and it is a curious
fact that Jalaluddin Rumi spent most of his life at
Iconium, where some traditions of the apostle's teaching
must have lingered. Other allusions to the Gospel
narrative in the <i>Masnavi</i> are found in the mention of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
John the Baptist leaping in his mother's womb, of
Christ walking on the water, &amp;c., none of which occur
in the Koran. Isolated verses of Jalaluddin's clearly
show a Christian origin:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I am the sweet-smiling Jesus,</span>
<span class="i1">And the world is alive by Me.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i0">I am the sunlight falling from above,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet never severed from the Sun I love.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that Jalaluddin gives our Lord a
much higher rank than is accorded to Him in the Koran,
which says, "And who could hinder God if He chose to
destroy Mary and her son together?"</p>

<p>A strange echo of the Gospel narrative is found in
the story of the celebrated Sufi, Mansur-al-Hallaj, who
was put to death at Bagdad, 919 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, for exclaiming
while in a state of mystic ecstacy, "I am the Truth."
Shortly before he died he cried out, "My Friend (God)
is not guilty of injuring me; He gives me to drink
what as Master of the feast He drinks Himself" (Whinfield,
preface to the <i>Masnavi</i>). Notwithstanding the
apparent blasphemy of Mansur's exclamation, he has
always been the object of eulogy by Mohammedan
poets. Even the orthodox Afghan poet, Abdurrahman,
says of him:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Every man who is crucified like Mansur,</span>
<span class="i0">After death his cross becomes a fruit-bearing tree.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the favourite Sufi phrases, "The Perfect
Man," "The new creation," "The return to God,"
have a Christian sound, and the modern Babi movement
which has so profoundly influenced Persian life and
thought owes its very name to the saying of Christ,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
"I am the Door" ("Ana ul Bab"), adopted by Mirza
Ali, the founder of the sect.</p>

<p>When Henry Martyn reached Shiraz in 1811, he
found his most attentive listeners among the Sufis.
"These Sufis," he writes in his diary, "are quite the
Methodists of the East. They delight in everything
Christian except in being exclusive. They consider
they all will finally return to God, from whom they
emanated."</p>

<p>It is certainly noteworthy that some of the highly
educated Indian converts from Islam to Christianity
have been men who have passed through a stage of
Sufism, <i>e.g.</i>, Moulvie Imaduddin of Amritsar, on
whom Archbishop Benson conferred a D.D. degree, and
Safdar Ali, late Inspector of Schools at Jabalpur.
In one of the semi-domes of the Mosque of St. Sophia
at Constantinople is a gigantic figure of Christ in mosaic,
which the Mohammedans have not destroyed, but
overlaid with gilding, yet so that the outlines of the
figure are still visible. Is it not a parable?</p>

<h3><a name="APPENDIX_IV" id="APPENDIX_IV"></a>APPENDIX IV</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">CHRIST IN MODAMMEDAN TRADITION.</span></h4>


<p>The following brief article is an attempt to bring
together some of the passages in Mohammedan
writers in which Christ is accorded a higher place than
in the Koran, and in which deeds and words of His are
mentioned regarding which the Koran is quite silent.
For though the Koran calls Him 'the Spirit of God'
and 'a Word proceeding from Him,' at the same time
it says 'What could hinder God if He chose to destroy
the Messiah and His mother both together?'</p>

<p>In the traditional sayings of Mohammed collected
by Al Bokhari, accepted by all Sunni Mohammedans,
we have the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The sinlessness of Christ. The Prophet said,
'Satan touches every child at its birth and it cries out
from the touch of Satan. This is the case with all,
except Mary and her son.'</p>

<p>2nd. A famous utterance of Christ is attributed to
God. The Prophet said, 'At the resurrection God shall
say, "O ye sons of men, I was sick and ye visited Me
not." They shall say, "Thou art the Lord of the worlds
how should we visit Thee?" He will say, "A certain
servant of Mine was sick; if you had visited him you
would have found Me with him."' This tradition is
noteworthy as it brings out the affinity between God
and man which the Koran for the most part ignores.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>3rd. Christ returning to judgment. The Prophet
said, 'How will it be with you when God sends back the
Son of Mary to rule and to judge (hakiman, muqsitan)?'</p>

<p>In the 'Awarifu-l-Mawarif of Shahabu-d-Din Suhrawardi
the doctrine of the New Birth is definitely attributed
to Christ: 'The death of nature and of will which
they call "the second birth" even as Christ has written.'</p>

<p>Ghazzali in the Ihya-ul-ulum thus refers to St. Matt.
xi. 17: 'Some one said, "I saw written in the Gospel,
We have sung to you but ye have not been moved with
emotion; we have piped unto you but ye have not
danced."' He also quotes St. Matt. vi. 25, 'Jesus
said, Consider the fowls, etc'</p>

<p>The historian Tabari mentions the institution of the
Last Supper, Christ's washing His disciple's hands,
requesting them to watch with Him, predicting Peter's
denial, and quotes the text, 'The shepherd shall be
smitten, and the sheep shall be scattered.'</p>

<p>In the Bostan of Sa'di the parable of the Publican
and the Pharisee takes the following curious shape:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Jesus' time there lived a youth so black and dissolute,</span>
<span class="i0">That Satan from him shrank appalled in every attribute;</span>
<span class="i0">He in a sea of pleasures foul uninterrupted swam</span>
<span class="i0">And gluttonized on dainty vices, sipping many a dram.</span>
<span class="i0">Whoever met him on the highway turned as from a pest,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, pointing lifted finger at him, cracked some horrid jest.</span>
<span class="i0">I have been told that Jesus once was passing by the cave</span>
<span class="i0">Where dwelt a monk who asked Him in,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly that slave of sin appeared across the way,</span>
<span class="i0">Far off he paused, fell down and sobbingly began to pray;</span>
<span class="i0">And like a storm or rain the tears pour gushing from his eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">'Alas, and woe is me for thirty squandered years,' he cries;</span>
<span class="i0">The pride-puffed monk self-righteous lifts his eyebrows with a sneer,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily exclaims, 'Vile wretch! in vain hast thou come here.</span>
<span class="i0">Art thou not plunged in sin, and tossed in lust's devouring sea?</span>
<span class="i0">What will thy filthy rags avail with Jesus and with me?</span>
<span class="i0">O God! the granting of a single wish is all I pray,</span>
<span class="i0">Grant me to stand far distant from this man at Judgement Day.'</span>
<span class="i0">From heaven's throne a revelation instantaneous broke,</span>
<span class="i0">And God's own thunder-words through the mouth of Jesus spoke:</span>
<span class="i0">'The two whom praying there I see, shall equally be heard;</span>
<span class="i0">They pray diverse,&mdash;I give to each according to his word.</span>
<span class="i0">That poor one thirty years has rolled in sin's most slimy steeps,</span>
<span class="i0">But now with stricken heart and streaming eyes for pardon weeps.</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold of My grace he throws him in despair,</span>
<span class="i0">And faintly hoping pity pours his supplications there.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore forgiven and freed from all the guilt in which he lies</span>
<span class="i0">My mercy chooses him a citizen of paradise;</span>
<span class="i0">This monk desires that he may not that sinner stand beside,</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore he goes to hell and so his wish is gratified.'</span>

<p>It is refreshing to find one of the classical Moslem
writers so strongly denouncing self-righteousness. The
poet Nizami in the following apologue seems to have
caught no little of the spirit of the Gospel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One evening Jesus lingered in the market-place</span>
<span class="i0">Teaching the people parables of truth and grace,</span>
<span class="i0">When in the square remote a crowd was seen to rise</span>
<span class="i0">And stop with loathing gestures and abhorring cries.</span>
<span class="i0">The Master and His meek Disciples went to see</span>
<span class="i0">What cause for this commotion and disgust could be,</span>
<span class="i0">And found a poor dead dog beside the gutter laid;</span>
<span class="i0">Revolting sight! at which each face its hate betrayed.</span>
<span class="i0">One held his nose, one shut his eyes, one turned away,</span>
<span class="i0">And all amongst themselves began loud to say,</span>
<span class="i0">'Detested creature! he pollutes the earth and air!'</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
<span class="i0">'His eyes are blear!' 'His ears are foul!' 'His ribs are bare!'</span>
<span class="i0">'In his torn hide there's not a decent shoe-string left!'</span>
<span class="i0">'No doubt the execrable cur was hung for theft!'</span>
<span class="i0">Then Jesus spake and dropped on him this saving wreath:</span>
<span class="i0">'Even pearls are dark before the whiteness of his teeth!'</span>
<span class="i10">(<i>Alger: Poetry of the Orient</i>.)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The entrance of our Lord into Jerusalem is referred
to in the following passage from the Masnavi of Jalaluddin
Rumi:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Having left Jesus, thou cherishest an ass,</span>
<span class="i0">And art perforce excluded like an ass;</span>
<span class="i0">The portion of Jesus is knowledge and wisdom,</span>
<span class="i0">Not so the portion of an ass, O assinine one!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou pitiest thine ass when it complains;</span>
<span class="i0">So art thou ignorant, thine ass makes thee assinine,</span>
<span class="i0">Keep thy pity for Jesus, not for the ass,</span>
<span class="i0">Make not thy lust to vanquish thy reason.</span>
<span class="i10">(<i>Whinfield's Translation</i>).</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere in the Masnavi Jalaluddin Rumi says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus, thy Spirit, is present with thee;</span>
<span class="i0">Ask help of Him, for He is a good Helper.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the Diwan-i-Shams-i-Tabriz, by the same author,
we have the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am that sweet-smiling Jesus,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world is alive through Me.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere he says, 'The pure one is regenerated by
the breath of Jesus.' It is a significant fact that Jalaluddin
Rumi spent most of his life at Iconium, where
very likely some apostolic traditions lingered.</p>

<p>One aspect of our Lord which has strongly impressed
itself on the Mohammedan imagination is His home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>lessness.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
Once on entering a Pathan village the writer
was met by a youth, who asked, 'Is this verse in the
Injil: "The Son of Mary had nowhere to lay His head"?'
In the Qissas-al-ambiya (Stories of the Prophets) this
takes the following grotesque shape:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One day Jesus saw a fox running through the wilderness. He
said to him, 'O fox! whither art thou going?' The fox answered,
'I have come out for exercise; now I am returning to
my own home.' Jesus said, 'Every one has built himself a
house; but for Me there is no resting-place.' Some people who
heard it, said, 'We are sorry for Thee and will build Thee a
house.' He replied, 'I have no money.' They answered, 'We
will pay all the expenses.' Then he said, 'Very well, I will
choose the site.' He led them down to the edge of the sea and,
pointing where the waves were dashing highest, said, 'Build
Me a house there.' The people said, 'That is the sea, O Prophet!
how can we build there?' 'Yea, and is not the world a sea,'
He answered, 'on which no one can raise a building that abides?'</p></div>

<p>A similar echo of Christ's words is found in the famous
inscription over a bridge at Fatehpur Sikri: 'Jesus
(upon Whom be peace) said, "The world is a bridge;
pass over it, but do not build upon it."</p>

<p>This keen sense of the transitoriness of everything
earthly is a strongly-marked feature of the Oriental
mind, and characterized all their saints and mystics.
There is no wonder that this side of the gospel should
make a special appeal to Orientals, and that the Fakir-missionary
should seem to them to approximate most
closely to his Master.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>
<p>The following account of the trial of our Lord before
the Sanhedrin and Pilate which occurs in the Dabistan
of Mohsin Fani (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1647) approximates more nearly
to the Gospel narrative than that which is ordinarily
current among Mohammedan writers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When Jesus appeared, the high-priest said, 'We charge Thee
upon Thy oath by the living God, say art Thou the Son of God?'
The blessed and holy Lord Jesus replied to him, 'I am what thou
hast said. Verily We say unto you, you shall see the Son of man
seated at the right hand of God, and He shall descend in the
clouds of heaven.' They said, 'Thou utterest a blasphemy,
because, according to the creed of the Jews, God never descends
in the clouds of heaven.'</p>

<p>Isaiah the prophet has announced the birth of Jesus in words
the translation of which is as follows:&mdash;'A branch from the root
of I'shai shall spring up, and from this branch shall come forth
a flower in which the Spirit of God shall dwell. verily a virgin
shall be pregnant and bring forth a Son.' I'shai is the name of
the father of David.</p>

<p>"When they had apprehended Jesus, they spat upon His blessed
face and smote Him. Isaiah had predicted it. 'I shall give up
My body to the smiters, and My cheek to the diggers of wounds.
I shall not turn My face from those who will use bad words and
throw spittle upon Me.' When Pilatus, a judge of the Jews,
scourged the Lord Jesus in such a manner that His body from
head to foot became but one wound, so was it as Isaiah had predicted,
'He was wounded for our transgressions; I struck Him
for His people.' When Pilatus saw that the Jews insisted upon
the death and crucifixion of Jesus, he said, 'I take no part
in the blood of this Man; I wash my hands clean of His blood.'
The Jews answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children.'
On that account the Jews are oppressed and curbed down in
retribution of their iniquities. When they had placed the cross
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>upon the shoulders of Jesus and led Him to die, a woman wiped
with the border of her garment the face, full of blood, of the
Lord Jesus. Verily she obtained three images of it and carried
them home; the one of these images exists still in Spain, the
other is in the town of Milan in Italy, and the third in the city
of Rome.</p></div>

<p>The same author, Mohsin Fani, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Gospel has been translated from the tongue of Jesus into
different languages, namely, into Arabic, Greek, Latin, which
last is the language of the learned among the Firangis; and into
Syriac, and this all learned men know.</p></div>

<p>Fragments of our Lord's teaching are found not only
in religious but also in secular Mohammedan books;
thus in the Kitab Jawidan of Ibn Muskawih we have
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The hatefullest of learned men in the eyes of God is he who
loves reputation and that room should be made for him in the
assemblies of the great, and to be invited to feasts. Verily I
say they have their reward in the world.</p></div>

<p>In the Kitab-al-Aghani, a history of Arabic poetry,
it is related:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Satan came to Jesus and said, 'Dost Thou not speak the
truth?' 'Certainly,' answered Jesus. 'Well then,' said
Satan, 'climb this mountain and cast Thyself down.' Jesus
said, 'Woe to thee, for hath not God said, O Son of Man, tempt
Me not by casting thyself into destruction, for I do that which
I will.'</p></div>

<p>From the above instances taken from well-known
Mohammedan writers it will be seen that the Christ of
post-Koranic tradition is far more life-like than the
Christ of the Koran. The latter is a mere lay-figure,
bedecked with honorific titles indeed, such as the 'Spirit
of God and a word proceeding from Him,' and working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
miracles, but displaying no character. In the post-Koranic
writers, on the other hand, we have His sinlessness,
His return to judgment, His humility, His unworldliness,
His sufferings, His doctrine of the New
Birth, topics upon which the Koran is entirely silent.
An open-minded Moslem perusing the above passages
in the original Persian and Arabic (and many might be
added) would certainly gain a far higher conception of
our Lord than from anything he would find in the
Koran.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">65</span></a><p> In one tradition He is called 'Imam al ashin,' 'Leader
of the wanderers.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">66</span></a><p> Although Mohammed said, 'There is no monkery in Islam,'
and rebuked one of his followers who showed a tendency to it,
celibacy and homelessness have often marked the saints of Islam.
</p><p>
One of them, Bishr Hafi, being asked why he did not marry,
answered, 'I am afraid of that verse in the Koran, "The rights
of women over men are the same as the rights of men over
women."'</p></div>
